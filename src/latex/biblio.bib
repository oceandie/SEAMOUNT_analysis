abstract = {The phase-averaged energy evolution for random surface waves interacting with oceanic turbulence is investigated. The change in wave energy balances the change in the production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). Outside the surface viscous layer and the bottom boundary layer the turbulent flux is not related to the wave-induced shear so that eddy viscosity parameterizations cannot be applied. Instead, it is assumed that the wave motion and the turbulent fluxes are not correlated on the scale of the wave period. Using a generalized Lagrangian average it is found that the mean wave-induced shears, despite zero vorticity, yield a production of TKE as if the Stokes drift shear were a mean flow shear. This result provides a new interpretation of a previous derivation from phase-averaged equations by McWilliams et al. It is found that the present source or sink of wave energy is smaller but is still on the order of the empirically adjusted functions used for the dissipation of swell energy in operational wave models, as well as observations of that phenomenon by Snodgrass et al.},

abstract = {The surface current response to winds is analyzed in a 2-yr time series of a 12-MHz (HF) Wellen Radar (WERA) off the west coast of France. Consistent with previous observations, the measured currents, after filtering tides, are on the order of 1.0%–1.8% of the wind speed, in a direction 10°–40° to the right of the wind, and with systematic trends as a function of wind speed. This Lagrangian current can be decomposed as the vector sum of a quasi-Eulerian current UE, representative of the top 1 m of the water column and part of the wave-induced Stokes drift Uss at the sea surface. Here, Uss is estimated with an accurate numerical wave model using a novel parameterization of wave dissipation processes. Using both observed and modeled wave spectra, Uss is found to be very well approximated by a simple function of the wind speed and significant wave height, generally increasing quadratically with the wind speed. Focusing on a site located 100 km from the mainland, the wave-induced contribution of Uss to the radar measurement has an estimated magnitude of 0.6%–1.3% of the wind speed, in the wind direction—a percentage that increases with wind speed. The difference UE of Lagrangian and Stokes contributions is found to be on the order of 0.4%–0.8% of the wind speed and 45°–70° to the right of the wind. This relatively weak, quasi-Eulerian current with a large deflection angle is interpreted as evidence of strong near-surface mixing, likely related to breaking waves and/or Langmuir circulations. Summer stratification tends to increase the UE response by up to a factor of 2 on average, and further increase the deflection angle of UE by 5°–10°. At locations closer to the coast, Uss is smaller and UE is larger with a smaller deflection angle. These results would be transposable to the World Ocean if the relative part of geostrophic currents in UE was weak, which is expected. This decomposition into Stokes drift and quasi-Eulerian current is most important for the estimation of energy fluxes to the Ekman layer.},

abstract = {New parameterizations for the spectral dissipation of wind-generated waves are proposed. The rates of dissipation have no predetermined spectral shapes and are functions of the wave spectrum and wind speed and direction, in a way consistent with observations of wave breaking and swell dissipation properties. Namely, the swell dissipation is nonlinear and proportional to the swell steepness, and dissipation due to wave breaking is nonzero only when a nondimensional spectrum exceeds the threshold at which waves are observed to start breaking. An additional source of short-wave dissipation is introduced to represent the dissipation of short waves due to longer breaking waves. A reduction of the wind-wave generation of short waves is meant to account for the momentum flux absorbed by longer waves. These parameterizations are combined and calibrated with the discrete interaction approximation for the nonlinear interactions. Parameters are adjusted to reproduce observed shapes of directional wave spectra, and the variability of spectral moments with wind speed and wave height. The wave energy balance is verified in a wide range of conditions and scales, from the global ocean to coastal settings. Wave height, peak and mean periods, and spectral data are validated using in situ and remote sensing data. Some systematic defects are still present, but, overall, the parameterizations probably yield the most accurate estimates of wave parameters to date. Perspectives for further improvement are also given.},

The general aims of the work were the es-timation of statistical wave parameters and the assessment of interannual and seasonal wave parameter variability. The domain of this study was the entire Black Sea. Wave param-eters were calculated by means of the SWAN wave model on a 5 × 5 km rectangular grid. Initial conditions (wind speed and direction) for the period between 1949 and 2010 were derived from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. According to our calculations the average significant wave height on the Black Sea does not exceed 0.7 m. Areas of most significant heavy sea are the southwestern and the northeastern parts of the sea as expressed in the spatial distribution of significant wave heights, wave lengths and periods. Besides, long-term an-nual variations of wave parameters were estimated. Thus, lin-ear trends of the annual total duration of storms and of their quantity are nearly stable over the hindcast period. However, an intensification of storm activity is observed in the 1960s– 1970s.},

abstract = {Abstract. A simulation of the Turkish Straits System (TSS) using a high-resolution, three-dimensional, unstructured mesh ocean circulation model with realistic atmospheric forcing for the 2008–2013 period is presented. The depth of the pycnocline between the upper and lower layers remains stationary after 6 years of integration, indicating that despite the limitations of the modelling system, the simulation maintains its realism. The solutions capture important responses to high-frequency atmospheric events such as the reversal of the upper layer flow in the Bosphorus due to southerly severe storms, i.e. blocking events, to the extent that such storms are present in the forcing dataset. The annual average circulations show two distinct patterns in the Sea of Marmara. When the wind stress maximum is localised in the central basin, the Bosphorus jet flows to the south and turns west after reaching the Bozburun Peninsula. In contrast, when the wind stress maximum increases and expands in the north–south direction, the jet deviates to the west before reaching the southern coast and forms a cyclonic gyre in the central basin. In certain years, the mean kinetic energy in the northern Sea of Marmara is found to be comparable to that of the Bosphorus inflow.},

abstract = {A concept of wave-amplitude-based Reynolds number is suggested which is hypothesised to indicate a transition from laminarity to turbulence for the wave-induced motion. If the hypothesis is correct, the wave-induced motion can be turbulent and the depth of upper ocean mixing due to such wave-generated turbulence can be predicted based on knowledge of the wave climate. Estimates of the critical wave Reynolds number provide an approximate value of Re cr = 3000. This number was tested on mechanically-generated laboratory waves and was confirmed. Once this number is used for ocean conditions when mixing due to heating and cooling is less important than that due to the waves, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the ocean's Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) are shown to be predicted with a satisfactory degree of agreement with observations. Testing the hypothesis against other known results in turbulence generation and wave attenuation is also conducted.},

The existence of such turbulence has been foreshadowed in a number of experimental, theoretical, and numerical studies. The current study presents direct measurements of this turbulence. The laboratory experiment was conducted by means of particle image velocimetry, which allowed estimates of wavenumber velocity spectra beneath monochromatic nonbreaking unforced waves. Observed spectra intermittently exhibited the Kolmogorov interval associated with the presence of isotropic turbulence. The magnitudes of the energy dissipation rates due to this turbulence in the particular case of 1.5-Hz deep-water waves were quantified as a function of the surface wave amplitude. The presence of such turbulence, previously not accounted for, can affect the physics of the wave energy dissipation, the subsurface boundary layer, and the ocean mixing in a significant way.},

abstract = {A hydrodynamical modelling of the Black Sea is presented using the GHER 3-D primitive equation model. Results of a very high resolution model with 5km grid size are analysed and the dominant features of general circulation in the Black Sea are highlighted. Compared with a coarse resolution model, forced with the same climatic monthly averaged atmospheric data, the high resolution model exhibits stronger variability, including frontal structures and coastal upwellings induced by baroclinic instabilities, in particular along the Turkish coast. A comparison of the shelf-open sea exchanges, with particular focus on the cold intermediate waters, shows that both models lead to a replenishment of the CIL in the basin interior by cold waters formed on the shelf. Due to the better representation of frontal structures, the high resolution model is an appropriate candidate for coupling with a biological model. Problems of calibration, interpretation and data availability typically arise from this kind of coupled 3-D model. In order to overcome such difficulties, the results of the 3-D hydrodynamical model are used to guide the development of an integrated 0-D box model capable of achieving the objectives of projects like EROS21, where the effect of changes in the Danube inflows on the shelf ecosystem is investigated. The 0-D model is thus designed to cover this region and is obtained through integration over an appropriate variable volume. The integration procedure shows where the weaknesses of an 0-D approach might lie. Diagnoses in the 3-D model of the integral quantities show the range of uncertainty one can expect in the exchange laws of the 0-D model.},

abstract = {The evolution of the Black Sea temperature, salinity and circulation, from large scale to mesoscale, is studied using a data-driven primitive equation simulation. The data are drawn from (i) a basin-wide hydrographic survey, CoMSBlack'92, obtained in the Summer of 1992; (ii) wind stress derived from wind analyses of the Sevastopol MSIA/URHI Office; (iii) climatological heat fluxes; and (iv) climatological river outflows. The primitive equation model is from the Harvard Ocean Prediction System. The simulation is used to examine the evolution of the circulation at mesoscale resolution, its dominant variabilities and dependencies in the summer period. The large-scale upper layer circulation over the deep portion of the basin is generally cyclonic with a system of anticyclonic eddies evolving in its periphery. The edge of the cyclonic circulation is dominated by an inertial jet: the Rim Current. As the Rim Current transverses the edge of the deep basin, the meandering and secondary circulation associated to the jet varies according to internal dynamics and interactions with the bottom topography and shelf water circulation. The relatively broad northwestern shelf is found to be mostly wind driven with a buoyancy-driven coastal current and interacting with the quasi-stationary Crimea and Kaliakra anticyclones. The seasonal thermocline is strengthened during this period and a zonal large-scale temperature gradient with warmer/colder sea-surface temperatures in the east/west is driven by the observed weak/strong winds. Some of the major circulation elements are partially verified using qualitative comparisons with the Summer of 1992 data and historical data; both in situ, and infrared and color remotely sensed data. The Rim Current meander shape and propagation parameters, eddy size and distribution, and the generation of rapid surface bound jets are found to be in good agreement with observations. The simulation shows two previously unobserved events: an anticyclonic eddy is shed near Sinop; and the anticyclones moving north along the Caucasian coast are formed and shed from the Batumi eddy. Imprints of these events are found in the historical record},

abstract = {A newly developed hybrid-coordinate ocean circulation model is documented and tested. Coordinate surfaces in this model adhere to isopycnals wherever this does not violate minimum layer thickness requirements; elsewhere, coordinate surfaces are geometrically constrained. The intent of this approach, some of whose features are reminiscent of the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) technique, is to combine the best features of isopycnic-coordinate and fixed-grid circulation models within a single framework. The hybrid model is an offshoot of the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model whose solutions, obtained under identical geographic and forcing conditions, serve as reference. Century-scale simulations on a coarse-mesh near-global domain show considerable similarities in the modeled thermohaline-forced circulation. Certain architectural details, such as the choice of prognostic thermodynamic variables ($\rho$,S versus T,S) and the algorithm for moving coordinate surfaces toward their reference isopycnals, are found to only have a minor impact on the solution. Emphasis in this article is on the numerical resiliency of the hybrid coordinate approach. Exploitation of the model's flexible coordinate layout in areas of ocean physics where pure isopycnic coordinate models only have limited options, such as mixed-layer turbulence parameterization, will be the subject of forthcoming articles.},

abstract = {A combined directional Stokes drift profile for swell and wind sea is presented. The profile can be used to calculate the shear under crossing seas and as such is relevant for Langmuir turbulence and Stokes–Coriolis forcing, but also for material advection. The swell is represented as either a monochromatic wave or as a Phillips spectrum, while the wind sea is represented as a Phillips spectrum. The profile is found to compare well against the full directional Stokes drift calculated from the 2D spectrum of ERA-Interim in an open-ocean location in the North Atlantic. The error compared to a Phillips-type unidirectional Stokes drift profile is markedly lower for a combined profile with a monochromatic swell Stokes profile. However, representing the swell as a Phillips-type Stokes drift profile yields even better results. The combined profile relies on integrated wave parameters readily available from wave models and can be calculated at low cost. The global Stokes drift climate is investigated using ERA-Interim reanalysis data with the intention of identifying regions dominated by crossing Stokes drift. We find that the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean probably experiences the greatest degree of crossing Stokes drift, and the entire subtropical band 20°–30°S/N exhibits a significant degree of crossing Stokes drift and swell dominance over the Stokes drift.},

abstract = {A deep-water approximation of the Stokes drift velocity profile is explored as an alternative to the monochromatic profile. The alternative profile investigated relies on the same two quantities required for the monochromatic profile, namely, the Stokes transport and the surface Stokes drift velocity. Comparisons with parametric spectra and profiles under wave spectra from the Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) and buoy observations reveal much better agreement than the monochromatic profile even for complex sea states. That the profile gives a closer match and a more correct shear has implications for ocean circulation models since the Coriolis–Stokes force depends on the magnitude and direction of the Stokes drift profile, and Langmuir turbulence parameterizations depend sensitively on the shear of the profile. The alternative profile comes at no added numerical cost compared to the monochromatic profile.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature A multi-envelope generalised coordinate system for numerical ocean modelling is introduced. In this system, computational levels are curved and adjusted to multiple ‘virtual bottoms' (aka envelopes) rather than following geopotential levels or the actual bathymetry. This allows defining computational levels which are optimised to best represent different physical processes in different sub-domains of the model. In particular, we show how it can be used to improve the representation of tracer advection in the ocean interior. The new vertical system is compared with a widely used z-partial step scheme. The modelling skill of the models is assessed by comparison with the analytical solutions or results produced by a model with a very high-resolution z-level grid. Three idealised process-oriented numerical experiments are carried out. Experiments show that numerical errors produced by the new scheme are much smaller than those produced by the standard z-partial step scheme at a comparable vertical resolution. In particular, the new scheme shows superiority in simulating the formation of a cold intermediate layer in the ocean interior and in representing dense water cascading down a steep topography.},

abstract = {Abstract. Six surface drifters (drogued at about 1 m depth) deployed in the inner German Bight (North Sea) were tracked for between 9 and 54 days. Corresponding simulations were conducted offline based on surface currents from two independent models (BSHcmod and TRIM). Inclusion of a direct wind drag (0.6 % of 10 m wind) was needed for successful simulations based on BSHcmod currents archived for a 5 m depth surface layer. Adding 50 % of surface Stokes drift simulated with a third-generation wave model (WAM) was tested as an alternative approach. Results resembled each other during most of the time. Successful simulations based on TRIM surface currents (1 m depth) suggest that both approaches were mainly needed to compensate insufficient vertical resolution of hydrodynamic currents. The study suggests that the main sources of simulation errors were inaccurate Eulerian currents and lacking representation of sub-grid-scale processes. Substantial model errors often occurred under low wind conditions. A lower limit of predictability (about 3–5 km day−1) was estimated from two drifters that were initially spaced 20 km apart but converged quickly and diverged again after having stayed at a distance of 2 km or less for about 10 days. In most cases, errors in simulated 25 h drifter displacements were of similar order of magnitude.},

@article{Capet2016,
abstract = {Abstract. We show that from 1955 to 2015, the inventory of oxygen in the Black Sea has decreased by 44 % and the basin-averaged oxygen penetration depth has decreased from 140 m in 1955 to 90 m in 2015, which is the shallowest annual value recorded during that period. The oxygenated Black Sea surface layer separates the world's largest reservoir of toxic hydrogen sulfide from the atmosphere. The threat of chemocline excursion events led to hot debates in the past decades arguing on the vertical stability of the Black Sea oxic/suboxic interface. In the 1970s and 1980s, when the Black Sea faced severe eutrophication, enhanced respiration rates reduced the thickness of the oxygenated layer. Re-increasing oxygen inventory in 1985–1995 supported arguments in favor of the stability of the oxic layer. Concomitant with a reduction of nutrient loads, it also supported the perception of a Black Sea recovering from eutrophication. More recently, atmospheric warming was shown to reduce the ventilation of the lower oxic layer by lowering cold intermediate layer (CIL) formation rates. The debate on the vertical migration of the oxic interface also addressed the natural spatial variability affecting Black Sea properties when expressed in terms of depth. Here we show that using isopycnal coordinates does not overcome the significant spatial variability of oxygen penetration depth. By considering this spatial variability, the analysis of a composite historical set of oxygen profiles evidenced a significant shoaling of the oxic layer, and showed that the transient "recovery" of the 1990s was mainly a result of increased CIL formation rates during that period. As both atmospheric warming and eutrophication are expected to increase in the near future, monitoring the dynamics of the Black Sea oxic layer is urgently required to assess the threat of further shoaling.},

abstract = {Present-day sea level changes in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea are studied using satellite altimetry. Analysis of altimetry data from Topex-Poseidon (T/P) between January 1993 and December 1998, and from ERS-1/2 between October 1992 and June 1996 shows that the mean rate of sea level rise is 7 ?? 1.5 mm/year over the Mediterranean Sea and 27 ?? 2.5 mm/ year over the Black Sea. The geographical distribution of the observed trends is rather uniform in the Black Sea unlike the Mediterranean Sea. There we observe, over the 6 years of analysis, a quite large (20-30 mm/year) sea level rise in the Levantine basin. In the Ionian Sea, on the other hand, a negative sea level trend is reported during that period. In the western basin, sea level trends are significantly lower, some regions rising and others falling. An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of the sea level data is presented which confirms the main features reported above. Analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) data over the two seas and over the same time span indicates that basin-scale trends are correlated with the altimetry-derived sea level trends; however, the spatial variations of SST trends are smoother than sea level trends, the latter presenting subbasin fluctuations. The spatial correlation between sea level trends and SST trends suggests that at least part of the sea level change reported during the few years over the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea is due to heating of surface layers. Moreover, the temperature and salinity increase reported since the early 1960s in the deep waters of the western Mediterranean basin and more recently since the early 1990s in the eastern basin may contribute to the observed sea level trend. However, the observed trends in the Mediterranean sea level for 1993-1998 may also result from the interannual/decadal variability of the upper ocean circulation that is predicted by theoretical circulation models. In the Black Sea, apart from a possible steric contribution, change in regional hydrology, in particular, a decrease in river runoff, could be responsible for observed sea level changes. Finally, we also present results of long-term sea level trends (multidecadal time scale) using tide gauge records. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

When the surface buoyancy flux is positive, the energy flux is negative: these types of basins have an estuarine circulation. Antiestuarine basins have a negative surface buoyancy flux, which provides a positive energy flux, augmenting the wind work in powering the circulation. The energy budget for the semienclosed seas with vertically separated flows at the strait is examined using reanalysis products for four major semienclosed basins: the Mediterranean and Red Seas (antiestuarine) and the Black and Baltic Seas (estuarine). Important differences in the relative contribution to the energy budget of the wind work versus the surface buoyancy flux are found within basins of the same typ...},

abstract = {Abstract Until recently, measurements below the ocean surface have tended to confirm ?law of the wall? behavior, in which the velocity profile is logarithmic, and energy dissipation decays inversely with depth. Recent measurements, however, show a sublayer, within meters of the surface, in which turbulence is enhanced by the action of surface waves. In this layer, dissipation appears to decay with inverse depth raised to a power estimated between 3 and 4.6. The present study shows that a conventional model, employing a ?level 2½? turbulence closure scheme predicts near-surface dissipation decaying as inverse depth to the power 3.4. The model shows agreement in detail with measured profiles of dissipation. This is despite the fact that empirical constants in the model are determined for situations very different from this near-surface application. The action of breaking waves is modeled by a turbulent kinetic energy input at the surface. In the wave-enhanced layer, the downward flux of turbulent kinetic energy balances its dissipation. The model produces analytic descriptions for the depth of the layer, and for profiles of velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, and dissipation. The surface roughness length (in the water) is a critical parameter in the solutions. There are indications of a relationship between the roughness length and surface wave parameter such as the amplitude or inverse wavenumber. Roughness lengths at least up to 1 m appear to be feasible.},

abstract = {Abstract. OpenDrift is an open-source Python-based framework for Lagrangian particle modelling under development at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute with contributions from the wider scientific community. The framework is highly generic and modular, and is designed to be used for any type of drift calculations in the ocean or atmosphere. A specific module within the OpenDrift framework corresponds to a Lagrangian particle model in the traditional sense. A number of modules have already been developed, including an oil drift module, a stochastic search-and-rescue module, a pelagic egg module, and a basic module for atmospheric drift. The framework allows for the ingestion of an unspecified number of forcing fields (scalar and vectorial) from various sources, including Eulerian ocean, atmosphere and wave models, but also measurements or a priori values for the same variables. A basic backtracking mechanism is inherent, using sign reversal of the total displacement vector and negative time stepping. OpenDrift is fast and simple to set up and use on Linux, Mac and Windows environments, and can be used with minimal or no Python experience. It is designed for flexibility, and researchers may easily adapt or write modules for their specific purpose. OpenDrift is also designed for performance, and simulations with millions of particles may be performed on a laptop. Further, OpenDrift is designed for robustness and is in daily operational use for emergency preparedness modelling (oil drift, search and rescue, and drifting ships) at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.},

abstract = {Validation of oil spill forecasting systems suffers from a lack of data due to the scarcity of oil slick in situ and satellite observations. Drifters (surface drifting buoys) are often considered as proxy for oil spill to overcome this problem. However, they can have different designs and consequently behave in a different way at sea, making it not straightforward to use them for oil spill model validation purposes and to account for surface currents, waves and wind when modelling them. Stemming from the need to validate the MEDESS4MS (Mediterranean Decision Support System for Marine Safety) multi-model oil spill prediction system, which allows access to several ocean, wave and meteorological operational model forecasts, an exercise at sea was carried out to collect a consistent dataset of oil slick satellite observations, in situ data and trajectories of different type of drifters. The exercise, called MEDESS4MS Serious Game 1 (SG1), took place in the Elba Island region (Western Mediterranean Sea) during May 2014. Satellite images covering the MEDESS4MS SG1 exercise area were acquired every day and, in the case an oil spill was observed from satellite, vessels of the Italian Coast Guard (ITCG) were sent in situ to confirm the presence of the pollution. During the exercise one oil slick was found in situ and drifters, with different water-following characteristics, were effectively deployed into the oil slick and then monitored in the following days. Although it was not possible to compare the oil slick and drifter trajectories due to a lack of satellite observations of the same oil slick in the following days, the oil slick observations in situ and drifters trajectories were used to evaluate the quality of MEDESS4MS multi-model currents, waves and winds by using the MEDSLIK-II oil spill model. The response of the drifters to surface ocean currents, different Stokes drift parameterizations and wind drag has been examined. We found that the surface ocean currents mainly drive the transport of completely submerged drifters. The accuracy of the simulations increases with higher resolution currents and with addition of the Stokes drift, which is better estimated when provided by wave models. The wind drag improves the modelling of drifter trajectories only in the case of partially emerged drifters, otherwise it leads to an incorrect reproduction of the drifters' direction, which is particularly evident in high speed wind conditions.},

@article{Doukakis2008,
abstract = {The Earth's weather and climate are the result of the redistribution of heat. The major source of heat to the surface of the Earth is the sun, principally through incoming visible radiation most of which is absorbed by the Earth's surface. The ocean redistributes this radiation and the atmosphere with the excess radiated back into space as longer wavelength, infrared radiation. Clouds and other gases, primarily water vapour and carbon dioxide, absorb the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and remit their own heat at much lower temperatures. This traps the Earth's radiation and makes the Earth much warmer than it would be otherwise. Over time, energy absorbed near the equator spreads to the colder regions of the globe, carried by winds in the atmosphere and by the currents in the ocean. Compared to the atmosphere, the ocean is much denser and has a much greater ability to store heat. The ocean also moves much more slowly than the atmosphere. Thus, the ocean and the atmosphere interact on different time scales. The ocean moderates seasonal and longer variations by storing and transporting, via ocean currents, large amounts of heat around the globe, eventually resulting in changing weather patterns. The ocean also plays an important role in climate change. Long-term impacts of climate change in coastal areas, such as sea level rise or storm surges, could result in the increased erosion of shores and associated habitat, increased salinity of estuaries and freshwater aquifers, altered tidal ranges in rivers and bays, changes in sediment and nutrient transport, and increased coastal flooding. The purpose of this document is to address relevant topics of the sea level rise driven by the changing climate and consider how climate changes could impact valuable coastal areas.},

abstract = {Recent observations over the Sigsbee Escarpment in the Gulf of Mexico have revealed extremely energetic deep currents (near 1 m s-1), which are trapped along the escarpment. Both scientific interest and engineering needs demand dynamical understanding of these extreme events, and can benefit from a numerical model designed to complement observational and theoretical investigations in this region of complicated topography. The primary objective of this study is to develop a modeling methodology capable of simulating these physical processes and apply the model to the Sigsbee Escarpment region. The very steep slope of the Sigsbee Escarpment (0.05-0.1) limits the application of ocean models with traditional terrain-following (sigma) vertical coordinates, which may represent the very complicated topography in the region adequately, can result in large truncation errors during calculation of the horizontal pressure gradient. A new vertical coordinate system, termed a vanishing quasi-sigma coordinate, is implemented in the Navy Coastal Ocean Model for application to the Sigsbee Escarpment region. Vertical coordinate surfaces for this grid have noticeably gentler slopes than a traditional sigma grid, while still following the terrain near the ocean bottom. The new vertical grid is tested with a suite of numerical experiments and compared to a classical sigma-layer model. The numerical error is substantially reduced in the model with the new vertical grid. A one-year, realistic, numerical simulation is performed to simulate strong, deep currents over the Escarpment using a very-high-resolution nested modeling approach. The model results are analyzed to demonstrate that the deep-ocean currents in the simulation replicate the prominent dynamical features of the observed intense currents in the region. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The pattern of surface circulation has been mapped for more than 40 lakes, marginal seas, estuaries, and lagoons. All are within the northern hemisphere, and all except one are known to have a counterclockwise pattern. This consistent pattern is attributed to the drag of wind blowing across the bodies of water. Warmer surface water is displaced to the right-hand shore zone (facing downwind), where it produces greater surface turbulence and, thus, greater wind drag. This effect leads to counterclockwise water circulation regardless of the direction and, within limits, the duration of the wind.},

abstract = {During the course of developing new numerical algorithms for a terrain-following ocean modeling system (TOMS), different numerical aspects have been evaluated through a comparison between two widely used community ocean models, the Princeton ocean model (POM) and the regional ocean modeling system (ROMS). While both models aim at modeling coastal to basin-scale problems using similar grids, their numerical algorithms, code structure, and parameterization options are very different. Sensitivity studies with an idealized channel flow and a steep seamount configuration demonstrate how different algorithms in the two models may affect numerical errors, the stability of the code and the computational efficiency. For example, new pressure gradient schemes, using polynomial fits and new time stepping algorithms may reduce numerical errors and allow using longer time steps than standard schemes do. However, the new schemes may require more careful choices of time steps and the use of higher order advection schemes to maintain numerical stability.},

abstract = {Sensitivity studies with a new generalized coordinate ocean model are performed in order to compare the behavior of bottom boundary layers (BBLs) when terrain-following (sigma or combined sigma and z-level) or z-level vertical grids are used, but most other numerical aspects remain unchanged. The model uses a second-order turbulence closure scheme that provides surface and BBL mixing and results in a quite realistic climatology and deep water masses after 100 year simulations with a coarse resolution (1?? ?? 1??) basin-scale terrain-following grid. However, with the same turbulence scheme but using a z-level grid, the model was unable to produce dense water masses in the deep ocean. The latter is a known problem for coarse resolution z-level models, unless they include highly empirical BBL schemes.A set of dense water overflow experiments with high-resolution grids (10 and 2.5 km) are used to investigate the influence of model parameters such as horizontal diffusivity, vertical mixing, horizontal resolution, and vertical resolution on the simulation of bottom layers for the different coordinate systems. Increasing horizontal diffusivity causes a thinner BBL and a bottom plume that extends further downslope in a sigma grid, but causes a thicker BBL and limited downslope plume extension in a z-level grid. A major difference in the behavior of the BBL in the two grids is due to the larger vertical mixing generated by the turbulence scheme over the step-like topography in the z-level grid, compared to a smaller vertical mixing and a more stably stratified BBL in the sigma grid. Therefore, the dense plume is able to maintain its water mass better and penetrates farther downslope in the sigma grid than in the z-level grid. Increasing horizontal and vertical resolution in the z-level grid converges the results toward those obtained by a much coarser resolution sigma coordinate grid, but some differences remain due to the basic differences in the mixing process in the BBL. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper outlines some important aspects of modeling oceanic fronts in the context of feature-oriented regional modeling for the deep sea and the Global Coastal Ocean. Previously developed forms of feature models for different types of fronts are presented in a generalized approach. The large-scale meandering frontal systems such as the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio and Brazil current can be represented by velocity-based feature models. Buoyancy forced coastal water mass fronts, such as the coastal currents, the tidal fronts, plume fronts, dense water fronts and inflow/outlfow fronts can be represented by a generalized parameterized water mass feature model. The interface region of the deep ocean and the coastal region can be modeled by a melding of two water masses along and across a prescribed isobath in the form of a shelf-break front. Initialization and/or updating fields for a regional dynamical model can then be established in association with other available synoptic data sets via a feature-oriented strategic sampling approach for forecasting and dynamical balances. Example simulations from the western north Atlantic (WNA) and the strait of Sicily region are presented in support of the applicability of this approach for the Global Coastal Ocean. Simulations in the strait of Sicily region with fronts, eddies and background climatology help provide a perspective on dynamical processes in this region. Application of this methodology for rapid assessment of any regional ocean, based on limited data and resources is now possible. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Models for the evolution of the surface mized later need to be improved to include dominant processes such as Langmuir circulation. It is shown that the wave forcing in Langmuir circulation models is much stronger than thatdue to a surface buoyancy loss, and studies of the erosion by the cells of a pre-existing stratification are described. Mixed layer models will also need to allow for horizontal inhomogeneity. It is shown, for example, that the horizontal buoyancy gradient that may be left behind after a storn produces restratificiation that can be significant. The nonlinearity of the equation of state is another real-world factor, it gives rise an annual average surface buoyancy that is misleading as it is compensated by interior cabbeling. Current work linking the mixed layer to water mass formation is also introduced.},

Dissipation rates of turbulence kinetic energy are estimated based on centered second-order structure functions at 4-Hz sampling. Dissipation rates within nonbreaking wave crests are on average 3 times larger than values found at the same distance to the free surface but within the wave trough region. This ratio increases to 18 times for periods with frequent wave breaking. The depth-integrated mean dissipation rate is a function of the wave field and correlates well with the mean wave saturation in the wave band $\omega$p ≤ $\omega$ ≤ 4$\omega$p. It shows a clear threshold behavior in accordance with the onset of wave breaking. The initial bubble size distribution is estimated from the observed distribution of energy dissipation rates, assuming the Hinze scale being the limiting size. This model yields the slope of the size distribution, , consistent with laboratory results reporte...},

abstract = {Observations of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dynamics in the ocean surface boundary layer are presented here and compared with results from previous observational, numerical, and analytic studies. As in previous studies, the dissipation rate of TKE is found to be higher in the wavy ocean surface boundary layer than it would be in a flow past a rigid boundary with similar stress and buoyancy forcing. Estimates of the terms in the turbulent kinetic energy equation indicate that, unlike in a flow past a rigid boundary, the dissipation rates cannot be balanced by local production terms, suggesting that the transport of TKE is important in the ocean surface boundary layer. A simple analytic model containing parameterizations of production, dissipation, and transport reproduces key features of the vertical profile of TKE, including enhancement near the surface. The effective turbulent diffusion coefficient for heat is larger than would be expected in a rigid-boundary boundary layer. This diffusion coefficient is predicted reasonably well by a model that contains the effects of shear production, buoyancy forcing, and transport of TKE (thought to be related to wave breaking). Neglect of buoyancy forcing or wave breaking in the parameterization results in poor predictions of turbulent diffusivity. Langmuir turbulence was detected concurrently with a fraction of the turbulence quantities reported here, but these times did not stand out as having significant differences from observations when Langmuir turbulence was not detected.},

abstract = {The dependence of results from coarse-resolution models of the North Atlantic circulation on the numerical advection algorithm is studied. In particular, the sensitivity of parameters relevant for climate simulations as e.g., meridional transport of mass and heat and main thermocline thickness is investigated. Three algorithms were considered: (a) a central difference scheme with constant values for horizontal and vertical diffusion, (b) an upstream scheme with no explicit diffusion, and (c) a flux-corrected transport (FCT) scheme with constant and strictly isopycnal diffusion. The temporal evolution of the three models on time scales of centuries is markedly different, the upstream scheme resulting in much shorter adjustment time whereas the central difference scheme is slower and controlled by vertical diffusion rather than advection. In the steady state, the main thermocline structure is much less diffusive in the FCT calculation which also has much lower heat transport. Both horizontal circulation and overturning in the meridional-vertical plane are strongest in the upstream-model. The results are discussed in terms of the effective vertical (diapycnal) mixing in the different models. A significant increase in vertical resolution would be required to eliminate the high sensitivity due to the numerical algorithms, and allow physically motivated mixing formulations to become effective.},

abstract = {A study is made of the distribution of temperature and salinity in the Weddell Sea. From this a clear picture emerges of the main features of the circulation over the continental shelf and continental slope. The main feature of the horizontal circulation is the Antarctic coastal current which enters the Weddell Sea from the east. This current leaves the coast near Halley Bay (7512¬∞S, 2712¬∞W) and flows along the edge of the continental shelf as a ribbon of cold fresh water between cold salty water on the shelf and the warm salty water characteristic of the circumpolar region. There is a circulation on the shelf in the vertical plane which carries about 106 m3sec‚{\`{a}}{\'{i}}1 of water off the shelf. The horizontal circulation on the shelf probably carries a flux of the same order. At the edge of the shelf in the western Weddell Sea, there is a V-shaped double front, above which lies the cold fresh water from the coastal current. The descending cold salty water from the shelf meets the warmer fresher water of the open-ocean pycnocline at the base of the V and the two waters mix to form bottom water which then runs down the continental slope. The characteristics of the bottom water formed vary with distance along the edge of the shelf, the bottom water becoming saltier and heavier with distance westwards. Bottom water is produced throughout the year, since there is always a supply of dense water from the continental shelf. The time taken for the dense water to run off the shelf and be replaced is several years. The mechanism by which the water on the shelf acquires its salinity is discussed. It is concluded that surface processes are responsible and that there is a net brine release over the continental shelf area because the pack ice is continually being blown off shore. It is estimated that the net brine release in a year is equivalent to the freezing of 1 m or more of ice. Discussion of water properties in the cold regions requires a proper appreciation of the equation of state. Attention has been drawn in the past to the variation of the thermal expansion coefficient with temperature, but the fact that it also varies strongly with depth has not been taken into account in many previous studies. Some consequences of this are discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract. This paper describes the next-generation ocean forecast model for the European north-west shelf, which will become the basis of operational forecasts in 2018. This new system will provide a step change in resolution and therefore our ability to represent small-scale processes. The new model has a resolution of 1.5 km compared with a grid spacing of 7 km in the current operational system. AMM15 (Atlantic Margin Model, 1.5 km) is introduced as a new regional configuration of NEMO v3.6. Here we describe the technical details behind this configuration, with modifications appropriate for the new high-resolution domain. Results from a 30-year non-assimilative run using the AMM15 domain demonstrate the ability of this model to represent the mean state and variability of the region.Overall, there is an improvement in the representation of the mean state across the region, suggesting similar improvements may be seen in the future operational system. However, the reduction in seasonal bias is greater off-shelf than on-shelf. In the North Sea, biases are largely unchanged. Since there has been no change to the vertical resolution or parameterization schemes, performance improvements are not expected in regions where stratification is dominated by vertical processes rather than advection. This highlights the fact that increased horizontal resolution will not lead to domain-wide improvements. Further work is needed to target bias reduction across the north-west shelf region.},

@article{Griffies1998,
abstract = {Abstract This paper considers the requirements that must be satisfied in order to provide a stable and physically based isoneutral tracer diffusion scheme in a z-coordinate ocean model. Two properties are emphasized: 1) downgradient orientation of the diffusive fluxes along the neutral directions and 2) zero isoneutral diffusive flux of locally referenced potential density. It is shown that the Cox diffusion scheme does not respect either of these properties, which provides an explanation for the necessity to add a nontrivial background horizontal diffusion to that scheme. A new isoneutral diffusion scheme is proposed that aims to satisfy the stated properties and is found to require no horizontal background diffusion.},

abstract = {The modelling of ocean circulation is important not only for its own sake, but also in terms of the prediction of weather patterns and the effects of climate change. This book introduces the basic computational techniques necessary for all models of the ocean and atmosphere, and the conditions they must satisfy. It describes the workings of ocean models, the problems that must be solved in their construction, and how to evaluate computational results. Major emphasis is placed on examining ocean models critically, and determining what they do well and what they do poorly. Numerical analysis is introduced as needed, and exercises are included to illustrate major points. Developed from notes for a course taught in physical oceanography at the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University, this book is ideal for graduate students of oceanography, geophysics, climatology and atmospheric science, and researchers in oceanography and atmospheric science. Features examples and critical examination of ocean modelling and results Demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches Includes exercises to illustrate major points and supplement mathematical and physical details},

abstract = {Nine free-drifting buoys were deployed for a period of 10 days in July 1990 in the western Irish Sea. High resolution buoy trajectories clearly revealed the existence of a cyclonic (anticlockwise) gyre with implied circulation velocities of 0.05 m s-1 and rotation time of about 10-15 days. Residual current vectors from ship-borne ADCP records extracted with the assistance of a numerical tidal model also showed cyclonic circulation in the region. The observed circulation pattern is consistent with geostrophic surface flow around a static, isolated dome of cold, dense, bottom water which is a repeatedly observed feature of the western Irish Sea summer density structure. It is suggested that the gyre may be important in promoting planktonic larval retention in the western Irish Sea. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {A new strategy for the vertical gridding in terrain-following 3D ocean models is presented here. The vertical grid adaptivity is partially given by a vertical diffusion equation for the vertical layer positions, with diffusivities being proportional to shear, stratification and distance from the boundaries. In the horizontal, the grid can be smoothed with respect to z-levels, grid layer slope and density. Lagrangian tendency of the grid movement is supported. The adaptive terrain-following grid can be set to be an Eulerian-Lagrangian grid, a hybrid ??-?? or ??- z grid and combinations of these with great flexibility. With this, internal flow structures such as thermoclines can be well resolved and followed by the grid. A set of idealised examples is presented in the paper, which show that the introduced adaptive grid strategy reduces pressure gradient errors and numerical mixing significantly. The grid adaption strategy is easy to implement in various types of terrain-following ocean models. The idealised examples give evidence that the adaptive grids can improve realistic, long-term simulations of stratified seas while keeping the advantages of terrain-following coordinates. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract. Regional seas are exceptionally vulnerable to climate change, yet are the most directly societally important regions of the marine environment. The combination of widely varying conditions of mixing, forcing, geography (coastline and bathymetry) and exposure to the open-ocean makes these seas subject to a wide range of physical processes that mediates how large scale climate change impacts on these seas' ecosystems. In this paper we explore these physical processes and their biophysical interactions, and the effects of atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial change on them. Our aim is to elucidate the controlling dynamical processes and how these vary between and within regional seas. We focus on primary production and consider the potential climatic impacts: on long term changes in elemental budgets, on seasonal and mesoscale processes that control phytoplankton's exposure to light and nutrients, and briefly on direct temperature response. We draw examples from the MEECE FP7 project and five regional models systems using ECOSMO, POLCOMS-ERSEM and BIMS_ECO. These cover the Barents Sea, Black Sea, Baltic Sea, North Sea, Celtic Seas, and a region of the Northeast Atlantic, using a common global ocean-atmosphere model as forcing. We consider a common analysis approach, and a more detailed analysis of the POLCOMS-ERSEM model. Comparing projections for the end of the 21st century with mean present day conditions, these simulations generally show an increase in seasonal and permanent stratification (where present). However, the first order (low- and mid-latitude) effect in the open ocean projections of increased permanent stratification leading to reduced nutrient levels, and so to reduced primary production, is largely absent, except in the NE Atlantic. Instead, results show a highly heterogeneous picture of positive and negative change arising from the varying mixing and circulation conditions. Even in the two highly stratified, deep water seas (Black and Baltic Seas) the increase in stratification is not seen as a first order control on primary production. The approaches to downscaled experiment design and lessons learned from the MEECE project are also discussed.},

abstract = {The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Three-Dimensional Baroclinic B grid model (POL3DB) has been developed to incorporate features suitable for the modeling of baroclinic processes on the shelf, at the shelf slope, and in ocean regions to allow long-term coupled ocean-shelf simulations. We test the model on the northwest European continental shelf in the period November 1988 to October 1989 against satellite sea surface temperature measurements, against CTD sections both on and off the shelf, and (in summary) against the whole of the North Sea Project CTD data set. The model accurately reproduces the seasonal cycle in the shelf-wide spatial temperature structure seen in the observations. Spatial correlations range from r = 0.92 in December to 0.79 in July, and the overall rms errors range from 0.8°C in April to 1.6°C in July. We demonstrate that the increase in the errors during the summer is due to uncertainties in modeling the vertical temperature structure. Compared with a climatology, the large-scale sea surface salinity structure is also well modeled (r = 0.80), but there is a tendency for the model to overestimate the salinity in the Norwegian Trench and underestimate it in the Kattegat. The s coordinates (a modified sigma-coordinate system) allow the formation of a seasonal mixed layer across the shelf break and into the northeast Atlantic with a modest vertical resolution. The accuracy to which this deep water region is modeled is limited by the initial and boundary conditions and by the extent of the model domain.},

abstract = {Shelf and coastal seas are regions of exceptionally high biological productivity, high rates of biogeochemical cycling and immense socio-economic importance. They are, however, poorly represented by the present generation of Earth system models, both in terms of resolution and process representation. Hence, these models cannot be used to elucidate the role of the coastal ocean in global biogeochemical cycles and the effects global change (both direct anthropogenic and climatic) are having on them. Here, we present a system for simulating all the coastal regions around the world (the Global Coastal Ocean Modelling System) in a systematic and practical fashion. It is based on automatically generating multiple nested model domains, using the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Modelling System coupled to the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model. Preliminary results from the system are presented. These demonstrate the viability of the concept, and we discuss the prospects for using the system to explore key areas of global change in shelf seas, such as their role in the carbon cycle and climate change effects on fisheries.},

abstract = {Accurately representing coastal and shelf seas in global ocean models represents one of the grand challenges of Earth system science. They are regions of immense societal importance through the goods and services they provide, hazards they pose and their role in global-scale processes and cycles, e.g. carbon fluxes and dense water formation. However, they are poorly represented in the current generation of global ocean models. In this contribution, we aim to briefly characterise the problem, and then to identify the important physical processes, and their scales, needed to address this issue in the context of the options available to resolve these scales globally and the evolving computational landscape. We find barotropic and topographic scales are well resolved by the current state-of-the-art model resolutions, e.g. nominal 1∕12°, and still reasonably well resolved at 1∕4°; here, the focus is on process representation. We identify tides, vertical coordinates, river inflows and mixing schemes as four areas where modelling approaches can readily be transferred from regional to global modelling with substantial benefit. In terms of finer-scale processes, we find that a 1∕12° global model resolves the first baroclinic Rossby radius for only ∼ 8 % of regions < 500 m deep, but this increases to ∼ 70 % for a 1∕72° model, so resolving scales globally requires substantially finer resolution than the current state of the art. We quantify the benefit of improved resolution and process representation using 1∕12° global- and basin-scale northern North Atlantic nucleus for a European model of the ocean (NEMO) simulations; the latter includes tides and a k-$\epsilon$ vertical mixing scheme. These are compared with global stratification observations and 19 models from CMIP5. In terms of correlation and basin-wide rms error, the high-resolution models outperform all these CMIP5 models. The model with tides shows improved seasonal cycles compared to the high-resolution model without tides. The benefits of resolution are particularly apparent in eastern boundary upwelling zones. To explore the balance between the size of a globally refined model and that of multiscale modelling options (e.g. finite element, finite volume or a two-way nesting approach), we consider a simple scale analysis and a conceptual grid refining approach. We put this analysis in the context of evolving computer systems, discussing model turnaround time, scalability and resource costs. Using a simple cost model compared to a reference configuration (taken to be a 1∕4° global model in 2011) and the increasing performance of the UK Research Councils' computer facility, we estimate an unstructured mesh multiscale approach, resolving process scales down to 1.5 km, would use a comparable share of the computer resource by 2021, the two-way nested multiscale approach by 2022, and a 1∕72° global model by 2026. However, we also note that a 1∕12° global model would not have a comparable computational cost to a 1° global model in 2017 until 2027. Hence, we conclude that for computationally expensive models (e.g. for oceanographic research or operational oceanography), resolving scales to ∼ 1.5 km would be routinely practical in about a decade given substantial effort on numerical and computational development. For complex Earth system models, this extends to about 2 decades, suggesting the focus here needs to be on improved process parameterisation to meet these challenges.},

abstract = {Annually integrated measurements of pCO2 have demonstrated that seasonally stratified regions of temperate shelf seas can be an important sink of atmospheric CO2. A key process to support this sink is the transport of carbon from shelf seas to below the permanent pycnocline of the deep ocean. Using a hydrodynamic model simulation of the northwest European Continental shelf, we find that both the large scale circulation and frictional processes support the off-shelf transport of carbon sufficiently quickly to remove ∼40% of the carbon sequestered by one growing season before the onset of the next. This transport is highly heterogeneous, with some regions being only weakly flushed. Only 52% of this exported carbon is transported below the permanent pycnocline, hence the shelf sea and open ocean carbon cycles are intrinsically coupled.},

abstract = {The coastal ocean meets the deep sea at the continental shelf edge. Questions of global change entail elucidation of the processes that determine the quantities, transformation and fate of materials transported between the shelf and ocean, the measurement and definition of exchange processes, and the development of prognostic models of exchanges. Physical processes control the large-scale movement and irreversible small-scale mixing of water and its constituents. At the shelf edge, steep bathymetry may inhibit ocean-shelf exchange, but in combination with stratification gives rise to special processes and modelling challenges. A preliminary assessment is made of coastal-trapped waves; along-slope currents, instability and meanders; eddies; upwelling, fronts and filaments; downwelling, cascading; tides, surges; internal tides and waves as potentially influential processes in ocean-shelf exchange, water-mass structure and general circulation, according to their scales and context. For this purpose, theory and previous measurements are interpreted. Future studies needed to improve this assessment are discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract. Ocean currents play a key role in Earth's climate – they impact almost any process taking place in the ocean and are of major importance for navigation and human activities at sea. Nevertheless, their observation and forecasting are still difficult. First, no observing system is able to provide direct measurements of global ocean currents on synoptic scales. Consequently, it has been necessary to use sea surface height and sea surface temperature measurements and refer to dynamical frameworks to derive the velocity field. Second, the assimilation of the velocity field into numerical models of ocean circulation is difficult mainly due to lack of data. Recent experiments that assimilate coastal-based radar data have shown that ocean currents will contribute to increasing the forecast skill of surface currents, but require application in multidata assimilation approaches to better identify the thermohaline structure of the ocean. In this paper we review the current knowledge in these fields and provide a global and systematic view of the technologies to retrieve ocean velocities in the upper ocean and the available approaches to assimilate this information into ocean models.},

abstract = {Dense water overflow off continental shelves (cascading) is one of the contributing processes of shelf-deep ocean exchange, and of topical interest to climate studies and nutrient fluxes. Dense water originating from cooling, evaporation, freezing and salinization on a shallow shelf spills over the shelf edge and may develop as near-bottom gravity current or an intermediate-depth intrusion. It is difficult to observe in nature due to its intermittent character. This paper provides an extensive inventory of observed cases of water cascades around the World Ocean, summarises their locations and individual properties, and provides statistics of the identified cases. The search for cascading was carried out using oceanographic databases and a literature review. This study identified 61 confirmed cases world-wide, including 25 cases in the Arctic seas, 12 at mid-latitudes, seven in sub-tropical and tropical regions, and 17 off the Antarctic shelves. Eighteen cascades had not been reported before. We analyze a set of numerical parameters of dense water cascades, allowing us to quantify, compare and contrast the properties of water cascades. The overall average density contrast between the confirmed cascades and ambient water is 0.37 (kg/m3); it can be as much as 2 (kg/m3) on some Arctic shelves. Frequently initiated by strong cooling at the surface, cascades often remain colder through the descent, thus supplying the deep ocean with colder and fresher water. In non-dimensional variables, the data from all climate zones fit well to a unique curve, which represents a relationship between a cascade's internal structure and the parameters describing its forcing. On average, the down-slope volumetric flux provided by dense water cascades is estimated as 0.05 to 0.08 Sv per 100 km of shelf edge.

abstract = {Abstract The use of density surfaces in the analysis of oceanographic data and in models of the ocean circulation is widespread. The present best method of fitting these isopycnal surfaces to hydrographic data is based on a linked sequence of potential density surfaces referred to a discrete set of reference pressures. This method is both time consuming and cumbersome in its implementation. In this paper the authors introduce a new density variable, neutral density $\gamma$n, which is a continuous analog of these discretely referenced potential density surfaces. The level surfaces of $\gamma$n form neutral surfaces, which are the most appropriate surfaces within which an ocean model's calculations should be performed or analyzed. The authors have developed a computational algorithm for evaluating $\gamma$n from a given hydrographic observation so that the formation of neutral density surfaces requires a simple call to a computational function. Neutral density is of necessity not only a function of the three state variables: s...},

abstract = {Numerical models of shelf seas must handle sharp gradients in thermoclines and fronts, and at the edges of patches of passive tracer, often in the presence of strong tidal currents, without introducing excessive numerical diffusion or spurious oscillations. In a sigma coordinate model there is an additional problem, since then purely horizontal motion over a sloping sea bed may introduce strong numerical diffusion in the vertical, which can artificially erode thermoclines. In this paper, two advection schemes applicable to shelf sea models are examined. They are based on TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) and PPM (Piecewise Parabolic Method) techniques. They are demonstrated to give satisfactory performance for tracer advection in one, two and three dimensions. They are both monotonic, and the PPM scheme has particularly low numerical diffusion. In two and three dimensions directional splitting is used, which is handled by following advection with each horizontal velocity component by adjustment of the sigma levels in each water column using the same advection scheme. The artificial vertical diffusion is then small, particularly with PPM. The two schemes are also compared in a three- dimensional model of a cylindrical eddy of relatively fresh water, released from rest in an open sea region. Here, both salinity and momentum are advected. Laboratory experiments show that after an initial period of adjustment the eddy should become unstable, with a growth of cyclonic- anticyclonic eddy pairs. This is reproduced in the model, with the PPM scheme again producing sharper results than the TVD scheme. Integrated second moment calculations are used to compare the schemes. These demonstrate the lower numerical diffusion of the PPM scheme. This advantage is achieved at the cost of greater computing time.},

abstract = {Ocean waves play an important role in processes that govern the fluxes across the air-sea interface and in the upper-ocean mixing. Equations for current and heat are presented that include effects of ocean waves on the evolution of the properties of the upper ocean circulation and heat budget. The turbulent transport is modeled by means of the level-212 Mellor-Yamada scheme, which includes an equation for the production and destruction of Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE). The TKE equation in this work includes production due to wave breaking, production due to wave-induced turbulence and/or Langmuir turbulence, effects of buoyancy and turbulent dissipation. As a first test, the model is applied to the simulation of the daily cycle in SST at one location in the Arabian sea for the period of October 1994 until October 1995. For this location, the layer where the turbulent mixing occurs, sometimes called the Turbocline, is only a few meters thick and fairly thin layers are needed to give a proper representation of the diurnal cycle. The dominant processes that control the diurnal cycle turn out to be buoyancy production and turbulent production by wave breaking, while in the deeper layers of the ocean the Stokes-Coriolis force plays an important role.},

The model is a primitive equation model with a K-profile parameterization (KPP) mixed layer submodel. It uses a hybrid vertical coordinate that combines the advantages of isopycnal, $\sigma$, and z-level coordinates in optimally simulating coastal and open-ocean circulation features. This model approach is applied to the Black Sea for the first time. HYCOM uses a newly developed time-varying solar penetration scheme that treats attenuation as a continuous quantity. This scheme includes two bands of solar radiation penetration, one that is needed in the top 10 m of the water column and another that penetrates to greater depths depending on the turbidity.

abstract = {Climatological variations of thermal and haline buoyancy fluxes are investigated in the Black Sea. Analyses are performed to determine whether or not thermal buoyancy flux due to net heat flux (or haline buoyancy flux due to freshwater flux) dominates net buoyancy flux in the Black Sea. The effect of the two types of buoyancy flux are examined using a ≈ 3.2 km resolution HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). In the Black Sea, salinity is increased by Bosphorus inflow and decreased by precipitation and the inflow from six major rivers. Thus, the monthly mean discharge values from six major rivers are used as additions to the precipitation field in the model. River discharges are obtained from four climatologies: (1) River DIScharge (RivDIS), (2) Perry, (3) University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and (4) Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). Statistical evaluations of climatological river discharges from these products result in similar annual mean values. However, there are differences in the seasonal cycle. In the case of Danube, which has the largest annual river discharge contribution of ≈ 6365 m3 s- l, RMS differences for river discharge values over the seasonal cycle are within ≈ 2% among all products. The Black Sea HYCOM simulation uses climatological monthly mean atmospheric forcing (wind and thermal forcing) from European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) Re-analyses. Buoyancy flux fields obtained from the HYCOM simulation demonstrate that thermal buoyancy flux dominates haline buoyancy flux in all months except March when the basin-averaged absolute ratio of former to the latter is 0.5 in the Black Sea. On the contrary, large buoyancy ratio values of ≫ 1 in other months explain the buoyancy is much more sensitive to variations in heating. It is also found that near the Bosphorus Strait in the Black Sea the strongly concentrated source of salty water typically penetrates into the deeper layers as a plume. Further analyses of mean buoyancy fluxes reveal nonexistence of deep convection in the Black Sea on climatological time scales. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Dead Sea is one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world. Observational evidence has been obtained of unexpected short-term water heating in the 2 m uppermost layer of this hypersaline lake, following a sharp drop in solar radiation under weak winds. This was carried out using Dead Sea buoy measurements. Passing frontal cloudiness mixed with significant dust pollution over the Judean Mountains and the Dead Sea, which occurred on March 22, 2013, led to a dramatic drop in noon solar radiation from 860 W m −2 to 50 W m −2 . This drop in solar radiation caused a short-term (1-hour) pronounced temperature rise in the uppermost layer of the sea down to 2 m depth. After the sharp drop in noon solar radiation, in the absence of water mixing, buoy measurements showed that the temperature rise in the uppermost layer of the Dead Sea took place for a shorter time and was more pronounced than the temperature rise under the regular diurnal solar cycle. The water heating could be explained by gravitational instability in the skin-surface layer, when the warm surface water with the increased salinity and density submerged, thereby increasing temperature in the layers below.},

abstract = {Abstract. The paper presents the development of the Black Sea community nowcasting and forecasting system under the Black Sea GOOS initiative and the EU framework projects ARENA, ASCABOS and ECOOP. One of the objectives of the Black Sea Global Ocean Observing System project is a promotion of the nowcasting and forecasting system of the Black Sea, in order to implement the operational oceanography in the Black Sea region. The first phase in the realization of this goal was the development of the pilot nowcasting and forecasting system of the Black Sea circulation in the framework of project ARENA funded by the EU. The ARENA project included the implementation of advanced modeling and data assimilation tools for near real time prediction. Further progress in development of the Black Sea nowcasting and forecasting system was made in the frame of ASCABOS project, which was targeted at strengthening the communication system, ensuring flexible and operative infrastructure for data and information exchange between the Black Sea partners and end-users. The improvement of the system was made in the framework of the ECOOP project. As a result it was transformed into a real-time mode operational nowcasting and forecasting system. The paper provides the general description of the main parts of the system: circulation and ecosystem models, data assimilation approaches, the system architecture as well as their qualitative and quantitative calibrations.},

Climatic variables\nused in the K¨oppen-Geiger system were calculated at\neach station and interpolated between stations using a twodimensional\n(latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with\ntension onto a 0.1×0.1 grid for each continent.

In this work we use drifting buoy measurements, hydrographic profiles and along-track Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) to reconstruct MDT of the Black Sea by the "synthetic" method. Obtained MDT shows a lot of mesoscale features, which are not present in previous MDT fields of the Black Sea, mostly based on climatic data. Moreover, gradients of sea level in the synthetic MDT are significantly higher compared to other fields, which is evidence of more intense currents in the basin. Validation of determined MDT field with independent dynamic heights and drifter buoy velocities shows good quantitative and qualitative coincidence over all Black Sea basin and improvements compare to previous fields. New Black Sea MDT will improve quality of altimetry-derived geostrophic velocities and lead to better understanding of the spatial and temporal features of the upper layer dynamics.},

abstract = {Obtained are the estimates of the Black Sea level trends for the period of 1992-2005 as derived from the tide-gage and satellite altimetry data. An estimated rate of the mean sea level rate calculated from the averaged altimetry data is 7.6 ± 0.3 mm/year that is by 2-3 times higher than the estimates for the previous periods. Such high values of the trend are evidently associated with the sea level variability features at the 10-year temporal scale. The Black Sea level trend is characterized by the high spatial variability: it amounts to 8-9.5 mm/year in the coastal areas of the Black Sea basin that exceeds the trend in the deep-water part by 1.5-2 times (4.5-6 mm/year). Such distribution is an effect of the cyclonic Rim Current intensification. Based on the difference in the sea level trends obtained from in-situ and altimetry measurements, the velocity of the vertical crustal motion is estimated for the Ukrainian coastal stations of the Black Sea. {\textcopyright} 2013 Allerton Press, Inc.},

abstract = {The effects of nonbreaking surface waves on upper-ocean dynamics enter the wave-averaged primitive equations through the Stokes drift. Through the resulting upper-ocean dynamics, Stokes drift is a catalyst for the fluxes of heat and trace gases between the atmosphere and ocean. However, estimates of the Stokes drift rely crucially on properly resolving the wave spectrum. In this paper, using state-of-the-art spatial measurements (in situ and airborne remote sensing) from a number of different field campaigns, with environmental conditions ranging from 2 to 13 m s−1 wind speed and significant wave height of up to 4 m, we characterize the properties of the surface wave field across the equilibrium and saturation ranges and provide a simple parameterization of the transition between the two regimes that can easily be implemented in numerical wave models. We quantify the error associated with instrument measurement limitations, or incomplete numerical parameterizations, and propose forms for the continuation of these spectra to properly estimate the Stokes drift. Depending on the instrument and the sea state, predictions of surface Stokes drift may be underestimated by more than 50%.},

abstract = {Two weeks of high-frequency radar measurements collected at the Alderney Race are compared with the results of a three-dimensional fully coupled wave–current model. Spatial current measurements are rare in this site, otherwise well investigated through modelling. Thus, the radar measurements offer a unique opportunity to examine the spatial reliability of numerical results, and can help to improve our understanding of the complex currents in the area. Comparison of observed and modelled surface current velocities showed a good agreement between the methods, represented by root mean squared errors ranging from 14 to 40 cm s −1 and from 18 to 60 cm s −1 during neap and spring tides, respectively. Maximum errors were found in shallow regions with consistently high current velocities, represented by mean neap and spring magnitudes of 1.25 m s −1 and 2.7 m s −1 , respectively. Part of the differences between modelled and observed surface currents in these areas are thought to derive from limitations in the k-epsilon turbulence model used to simulate vertical mixing, when the horizontal turbulent transport is high. In addition, radar radial currents showed increased variance over the same regions, and might also be contributing to the discrepancies found. Correlation analyses yielded magnitudes above 0.95 over the entire study area, with better agreement during spring than during neap tides, probably because of an increase in the phase lag between radar and model velocities during the latter.},

abstract = {The coastal zone hosts a great number of activities that require knowledge of the spatial characteristics of the wave field, which in coastal seas can be highly heterogeneous. Information of this type can be obtained from HF radars, which offer attractive performance characteristics in terms of temporal and spatial resolution. This paper presents the validation of radar-derived fields of directional wave spectra. These were retrieved from measurements collected with an HF radar system specifically deployed for wave measurement, using an established inversion algorithm. Overall, the algorithm reported accurate estimates of directional spectra, whose main distinctive characteristic was that the spectral energy was typically spread over a slightly broader range of frequencies and directions than in their in situ-measured counterparts. Two errors commonly reported in previous studies, namely the overestimation of wave heights and noise related to short measurement periods, were not observed in our results. The maximum wave height recorded by two in situ devices differed by 30 cm on average from the radar-measured values, and with the exception of the wave spreading, the standard deviations of the radar wave parameters were between 3% and 20% of those obtained with the in situ datasets, indicating the two were similarly grouped around their means. At present, the main drawback of the method is the high quality signal required to perform the inversion. This is in part responsible for a reduced data return, which did not exceed 55% at any grid cell over the eight-month period studied here.},

abstract = {Rivers are important sources of freshwater and nutrients for the Mediterranean and Black Sea. We present a reconstruction of the spatial and temporal variability of these inputs since the early 1960s, based on a review of available data on water discharge, nutrient concentrations and climatic parameters. Our compilation indicates that Mediterranean rivers suffer from a significant reduction in freshwater discharge, contrary to rivers of the Black Sea, which do not have clear discharge trends. We estimate this reduction to be at least about 20% between 1960 and 2000. It mainly reflects recent climate change, and dam construction may have reduced discharge even further. A similar decrease can also be expected for the fluxes of dissolved silica (Si), strongly controlled by water discharge and potentially reduced by river damming as well. This contrasts with the fluxes of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in Mediterranean and Black Sea rivers, which were strongly enhanced by anthropogenic sources. Their total inputs to the Mediterranean Sea could have increased by a factor of >5. While N still remained at elevated levels in 2000, P only increased up to the 1980-1990s, and then rapidly dropped down to about the initial values of the 1960s. With respect to the marine primary production that can be supported by the riverine nutrient inputs, Mediterranean and the Black Sea rivers were mostly phosphorus limited during the study period. Their anthropogenic nutrient enrichment could only have had a fertilizing effect before the general decline of the P loads. When also considering Si as a limiting element, which is the case for siliceous primary producers such as diatoms, silica limitation may have become a widespread phenomenon in the Mediterranean rivers since the early 1980s. For the Black Sea rivers, this already started the late 1960s. Gross primary production sustained by rivers (PPR) represents only less than 2% of the gross production (PP) in the Mediterranean, and less than 5% in the Black Sea. Possible ecological impacts of the changing river inputs should therefore be visible only in productive coastal areas, such as the Gulf of Lions, where PPR can reach more than two thirds of PP. Reported ecosystem changes both in the Adriatic Sea and the Black Sea are concomitant with major changes in the reconstructed river inputs. Further work combining modelling and data collection is needed to test whether this may also have been the case for coastal ecosystems at other places in the Mediterranean and Black Sea. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The deep and abyssal potential temperature and salinity of the major areas of the world ocean have been re-examined in the hope that recent data may extend the conventional concepts of the formation and circulation of the deeper waters. In addition to these properties, which have been considered before, the potential density ($\delta$$\theta${symbol}) has been included. Potential denstity, in which density is calculated from the in situ temperature and salinity values moved adiabatically to sea-surface pressure, has been useful in defining mixing surfaces for shallow water. A peculiarity of this quantity in the western Atlantic Ocean is that it has a maximum above the bottom (though the column is stable) between about 40°N and 35°S. These high values originate from the Greenland-Norwegian Sea area and represent the lower North Atlantic Deep Water. This distribution suggests that $\delta$$\theta${symbol} surfaces at great depth cannot be interpreted as surfaces of mixing or flow but that $\delta$$\theta${symbol} can be interpreted as a conservative quantity whose extreme values can represent areas of water-mass formation and paths of flow. The lower North Atlantic Deep Water is a very good example of such a water mass: it can be traced by the maximum in $\delta$$\theta${symbol} to 35°S at least. Beyond there the $\delta$$\theta${symbol} maximum is either too weak to be followed or disappears entirely; some other quantity must be used if it is to be followed farther. If we wish to follow deeper water we can calculate density using a deeper reference pressure, for example 4000 dbars. This new quantity increases monotonically downward at great depth. An isopycnal of this quantity can be chosen to represent a mixing surface for the lower North Atlantic Deep Water and to trace this water much farther south.},

abstract = {The climatic circulation of the Gulf of Trieste, which is a shallow semienclosed basin in the closed northeastern end of the northern Adriatic, is studied with a numerical model. In all seasons there is a general inflow into the Gulf of Trieste at its lower, deeper part. This inflow makes a cyclonic turn centered in the southern part during average winter conditions. This turn is enhanced during spring and closes in an elongated cyclonic gyre during average summer conditions. In spring and summer, the cyclonic gyre is coupled with an anticyclonic gyre near the closed eastern part of the gulf. A “dome”-like density profile across the gulf's axis in the inner part of the gulf above the bottom appears with this circulation during spring and summer. In climatic autumn there is a smaller anticyclonic gyre on its southern side. Near the sea surface there is an outflow during winter, which is driven by the dominant “bora” wind blowing along the gulf's axis. This outflow, however, is detached from the southern coastline to the right, and crosses the gulf diagonally, merging with the belt of freshwater outflow along the northern coastline. This is shown to be a consequence of the balance between the pressure gradient force caused by elevation piled up in the direction out of the gulf, the Coriolis force, and vertical friction between layers near the sea surface. During the stratified season the surface of the gulf is occupied by an anticyclonic gyre due to the inertial plume of the Isonzo River.},

Subdivisions with fat cells satisfy a property called the packing constraint, which bounds the number of disjoint cells of a given size that can overlap a ball of a given radius.

abstract = {Abstract. This work describes the design and validation of a high-resolution (1/36°) ocean forecasting model over the "Iberian–Biscay–Irish" (IBI) area. The system has been set-up using the NEMO model (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean). New developments have been incorporated in NEMO to make it suitable to open- as well as coastal-ocean modelling. In this paper, we pursue three main objectives: (1) to give an overview of the model configuration used for the simulations; (2) to give a broad-brush account of one particular aspect of this work, namely consistency verification; this type of validation is conducted upstream of the implementation of the system before it is used for production and routinely validated; it is meant to guide model development in identifying gross deficiencies in the modelling of several key physical processes; and (3) to show that such a regional modelling system has potential as a complement to patchy observations (an integrated approach) to give information on non-observed physical quantities and to provide links between observations by identifying broader-scale patterns and processes. We concentrate on the year 2008. We first provide domain-wide consistency verification results in terms of barotropic tides, transports, sea surface temperature and stratification. We then focus on two dynamical subregions: the Celtic shelves and the Bay of Biscay slope and deep regions. The model–data consistency is checked for variables and processes such as tidal currents, tidal fronts, internal tides and residual elevation. We also examine the representation in the model of a seasonal pattern of the Bay of Biscay circulation: the warm extension of the Iberian Poleward Current along the northern Spanish coast (Navidad event) in the winter of 2007–2008.},

abstract = {In this paper, we identify a crucial numerical problem in sigma coordinate models, leading to unacceptable spurious diapycnal mixing. This error is a by-product of recent advances in numerical methods, namely the implementation of high-order diffusive advection schemes. In the case of ROMS, spurious mixing is produced by its third-order upwind advection scheme, but our analysis suggests that all diffusive advection schemes would behave similarly in all sigma models. We show that the common idea that spurious mixing decreases with resolution is generally false. In a coarse-resolution regime, spurious mixing increases as resolution is refined, and may reach its peak value when eddy-driven lateral mixing becomes explicitly resolved. At finer resolution, diffusivities are expected to decrease but with values that only become acceptable at resolutions finer than the kilometer. The solution to this problem requires a specifically designed advection scheme. We propose and validate the RSUP3 scheme, where diffusion is split from advection and is represented by a rotated biharmonic diffusion scheme with flow-dependent hyperdiffusivity satisfying the Peclet constraint. The rotated diffusion operator is designed for numerical stability, which includes improvements of linear stability limits and a clipping method adapted to the sigma-coordinate. Realistic model experiments in a southwest Pacific configuration show that RSUP3 is able to preserve low dispersion and diffusion capabilities of the original third-order upwind scheme, while preserving water mass characteristics. There are residual errors from the rotated diffusion operator, but they remain acceptable. The use of a constant diffusivity rather than the Peclet hyperdiffusivity tends to increase these residual errors which become unacceptable with Laplacian diffusion. Finally, we have left some options open concerning the use of time filters as an alternative to spatial diffusion. A temporal discretization approach to the present problem (including implicit discretization) will be reported in a following paper. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Regional oceanic models can be developed and used efficiently for the investigation of regional and coastal domains, provided a satisfactory prescription for the open boundary conditions (OBCs) is found. We propose in this paper an adaptive algorithm where inward and outward information fluxes are treated separately. Because of the essentially hyperbolic nature of the incompressible, hydrostatic Primitive Equations, external data are required only for inward boundary fluxes. The outward fluxes are treated with a new algorithm for two-dimensional radiation. Special attention is given to the estimation of the radiation phase speed, essential for detecting the direction of boundary fluxes. The boundary conditions are applied and assessed on a US West Coast (USWC) configuration of the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS). Our guiding principles are that the numerical solution be stable over multiple years, reach a meaningful statistical equilibrium, and be realistic with respect to the available observational data. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the oblique radiation is robust and sufficiently accurate to detect the direction of information fluxes. The adaptive nudging adequately incorporates the external information minimizing over- and under-specification problems. In addition, a volume constraint based on global correction of normal barotropic velocities improves the overall performances of the open boundary conditions. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract. The European Slope Current provides a shelf-edge conduit for Atlantic Water, a substantial fraction of which is destined for the northern North Sea, with implications for regional hydrography and ecosystems. Drifters drogued at 50 m in the European Slope Current at the Hebridean shelf break follow a wide range of pathways, indicating highly variable Atlantic inflow to the North Sea. Slope Current pathways, timescales and transports over 1988–2007 are further quantified in an eddy-resolving ocean model hindcast. Particle trajectories calculated with model currents indicate that Slope Current water is largely recruited from the eastern subpolar North Atlantic. Observations of absolute dynamic topography and climatological density support theoretical expectations that Slope Current transport is to first order associated with meridional density gradients in the eastern subpolar gyre, which support a geostrophic inflow towards the slope. In the model hindcast, Slope Current transport variability is dominated by abrupt 25–50 % reductions of these density gradients over 1996–1998. Concurrent changes in wind forcing, expressed in terms of density gradients, act in the same sense to reduce Slope Current transport. This indicates that coordinated regional changes of buoyancy and wind forcing acted together to reduce Slope Current transport during the 1990s. Particle trajectories further show that 10–40 % of Slope Current water is destined for the northern North Sea within 6 months of passing to the west of Scotland, with a general decline in this percentage over 1988–2007. Salinities in the Slope Current correspondingly decreased, evidenced in ocean analysis data. Further to the north, in the Atlantic Water conveyed by the Slope Current through the Faroe–Shetland Channel (FSC), salinity is observed to increase over this period while declining in the hindcast. The observed trend may have broadly compensated for a decline in the Atlantic inflow, limiting salinity changes in the northern North Sea during this period. Proxies for both Slope Current transport and Atlantic inflow to the North Sea are sought in sea level height differences across the FSC and between Shetland and the Scottish mainland (Wick). Variability of Slope Current transport on a wide range of timescales, from seasonal to multi-decadal, is implicit in sea level differences between Lerwick (Shetland) and T{\'{o}}rshavn (Faroes), in both tide gauge records from 1957 and a longer model hindcast spanning 1958–2012. Wick–Lerwick sea level differences in tide gauge records from 1965 indicate considerable decadal variability in the Fair Isle Current transport that dominates Atlantic inflow to the northwest North Sea, while sea level differences in the hindcast are dominated by strong seasonal variability. Uncertainties in the Wick tide gauge record limit confidence in this proxy.},

abstract = {When a force is applied to the ocean, fluid parcels are accelerated both locally, by the applied force, and nonlocally, by the pressure gradient forces established to maintain continuity and satisfy the kinematic boundary condition. The net acceleration can be represented through a “rotational force” in the rotational component of the momentum equation. This approach elucidates the correspondence between momentum and vorticity descriptions of the large-scale ocean circulation: if two terms balance pointwise in the rotational momentum equation, then the equivalent two terms balance pointwise in the vorticity equation. The utility of the approach is illustrated for three classical problems: barotropic Rossby waves, wind-driven circulation in a homogeneous basin, and the meridional overturning circulation in an interhemispheric basin. In the hydrostatic limit, it is shown that the rotational forces further decompose into depth-integrated forces that drive the wind-driven gyres and overturning forces that are confined to the basin boundaries and drive the overturning circulation. Potential applications of the approach to diagnosing the output of ocean circulation models, alternative and more accurate formulations of numerical ocean models, the dynamics of boundary layer separation, and eddy forcing of the large-scale ocean circulation are discussed.},

abstract = {We review what is known about the convective process in the open ocean, in which the properties of large volumes of water are changed by intermittent, deep-reaching convection, triggered by winter storms. Observational, laboratory, and modeling studies reveal a fascinating and complex interplay of convective and geostrophic scales, the large-scale circulation of the ocean, and the prevailing meteorology. Two aspects make ocean convection interesting from a theoretical point of view. First, the timescales of the convective process in the ocean are sufficiently long that it may be modified by the Earth's rotation; second, the convective process is localized in space so that vertical buoyancy transfer by upright convection can give way to slantwise transfer by baroclinic instability. Moreover, the convective and geostrophic scales are not very disparate from one another. Detailed observations of the process in the Labrador, Greenland, and Mediterranean Seas are described, which were made possible by new observing technology. When interpreted in terms of underlying dynamics and theory and the context provided by laboratory and numerical experiments of rotating convection, great progress in our description and understanding of the processes at work is being made.},

abstract = {Sigma coordinate ocean models, such as the Princeton Ocean Model, are a type of terrain-following model, which are currently being used in regions with large topographic variability such as entire ocean basins, shelf breaks, continental shelves, estuaries and bays. The main concern when using a terrain-following ocean model is to reduce the pressure gradient force error (PGFE). Regardless of the method of calculation of the pressure gradient, the PGFE will not be reduced to an acceptable value without first reducing the slope parameter, defined by the absolute value of the ratio of the difference between two adjacent cell depths and their mean depth. Here two methods for reducing the slope parameter are compared: a traditional two-dimensional smoothing with Gaussian filters and an alternative one-dimensional robust direct iterative technique. While both methods efficiently smooth the bottom topography so that the pressure gradient errors are reduced to acceptable levels, the alternative method is shown to have a unique advantage of maintaining coastline irregularities, continental shelves, and relative maxima such as seamounts and islands.},

A radiation transfer model is employed for the estimation of the net solar and terrestrial energy fluxes, instead of commonly used parameterizations. The agreement with radiation fluxes measured at surface stations is within 10Wm2. The Red Sea net solar flux estimate is lower than past studies, while the Black Sea heat budget components are comparable to some past results. The monthly heat content of both seas is estimated from water temperature and salinity profiles and is found to dominate the seasonal energy exchange between the water and the atmosphere, as for the Mediterranean Sea. The latent heat flux is calculated using two methodologies: the bulk aerodynamic and the energy balance method. Our annual results for the Red and Black seas show solar heating of 238 and 139Wm2, respectively. The evaporation rates are 2120 and 960 mm yr1, respectively.

The epineutral diffusion achieved by this small-slope approximation is not exactly in the direction of the correct epineutral tracer gradient. That is, the use of the small-slope approximation leads to a very small flux of tracer in a direction in which there is no epineutral gradient of tracer. For (the tracer) temperature or salinity, the difference between the correct epineutral gradient and the small-slope approximation to it is proportional to neutral helicity. The authors also make the point that small-scale turbulent mixing processes act to diffuse tracers isotropically (i.e., the same in each spatial direction) and hence it is strictly a misnomer to call this process ?dianeutral diffusion? or ?vertical diffusion.? This realization also has implications for the diffusion tensor.},

abstract = {surface gravity waves have a mean Lagrangian motion, the Stokes drift.\nThe dynamics of wind-driven, basin-scale oceanic currents in the\npresence of Stokes drift are modified by the addition of so-called\nvortex forces and wave-induced material advection, as well by wave-averaged\neffects in the surface boundary conditions for the dynamic pressure,\nsea level, and vertical velocity. Some theoretical analyses previously\nhave been made for the gravity wave influences on boundary-layer\nmotions, including the Ekman currents. The present paper extends\nthis theory to the basin-scale, depth-integrated circulation in a\nbounded domain. It is shown that the Sverdrup circulation relation,\nwith the meridional transport proportional to the curl of the surface\nwind stress, applies to Lagrangian transport, while the associated\nEulerian transport is shown to have a component opposite to the Stokes-drift\ntransport. A wave-induced correction to the relation between sea\nlevel and surface dynamic pressure is also derived. Preliminary assessments\nare made of the relative importance of these influences using a global\nwind climatology and an empirical relationship between the wind and\nwave fields.

Furthermore, drastic reductions in the discharge of many rivers may be altering the hydrological balance of the Black Sea. Though of similar surface area to the North Sea or the Baltic, the Black Sea is currently unprotected by any common management regime. This is a particularly serious situation since it is affected by the activities of at least 160 million inhabitants of its drainage basin (almost one half of which are from non-riparian countries in the catchment area of the Danube).

In this paper, it is shown that the differencing scheme cited here, though conventional, is not hydrostatically inconsistent; the sigma coordinate, pressure gradient error decreases with the square of the vertical and horizontal grid size. Furthermore, it is shown that the pressure gradient error is advectively eliminated after a long time integration. At the other extreme, it is shown that diagnostic calculations of the North Atlantic Ocean using rather coarse resolution, and where the temperature and salinity and the pressure gradient error are held constant, do not exhibit significant differences when compared to a calculation where horizontal pressure gradients are computed on z-level coordinates. Finally, a way of canceling the error ab initio is suggested.},

The initial error is numerically consistent in that it decreases as the square of the grid increment size. In this paper, we label this error as a sigma error of the first kind. In three-dimensional applications, the authors have encountered an error that did not disappear and that has not been understood by us or, apparently, others. This is a vorticity error that is labeled a sigma error of the second kind and is a subject of this paper. Although it does not prognostically disappear, it seems to be tolerably small.

The most intense activity of sub-basin Batumi Eddy occurs in summer with greater speeds and dimensions in 2006 and 2008. The sub-basin Sevastopol Eddy is generated in spring from a meander of the Rim Current.

abstract = {Abstract. The Dead Sea is a terminal lake, located in an arid environment. Evaporation is the key component of the Dead Sea water budget and accounts for the main loss of water. So far, lake evaporation has been determined by indirect methods only and not measured directly. Consequently, the governing factors of evaporation are unknown. For the first time, long-term eddy covariance measurements were performed at the western Dead Sea shore for a period of 1 year by implementing a new concept for onshore lake evaporation measurements. To account for lake evaporation during offshore wind conditions, a robust and reliable multiple regression model was developed using the identified governing factors wind velocity and water vapour pressure deficit. An overall regression coefficient of 0.8 is achieved. The measurements show that the diurnal evaporation cycle is governed by three local wind systems: a lake breeze during daytime, strong downslope winds in the evening, and strong northerly along-valley flows during the night. After sunset, the strong winds cause half-hourly evaporation rates which are up to 100% higher than during daytime. The median daily evaporation is 4.3mm d−1 in July and 1.1mm d−1 in December. The annual evaporation of the water surface at the measurement location was 994±88mm a−1 from March 2014 until March 2015. Furthermore, the performance of indirect evaporation approaches was tested and compared to the measurements. The aerodynamic approach is applicable for sub-daily and multi-day calculations and attains correlation coefficients between 0.85 and 0.99. For the application of the Bowen ratio energy budget method and the Priestley–Taylor method, measurements of the heat storage term are inevitable on timescales up to 1 month. Otherwise strong seasonal biases occur. The Penman equation was adapted to calculate realistic evaporation, by using an empirically gained linear function for the heat storage term, achieving correlation coefficients between 0.92 and 0.97. In summary, this study introduces a new approach to measure lake evaporation with a station located at the shoreline, which is also transferable to other lakes. It provides the first directly measured Dead Sea evaporation rates as well as applicable methods for evaporation calculation. The first one enables us to further close the Dead Sea water budget, and the latter one enables us to facilitate water management in the region.},

abstract = {Using hydrographic data collected by CTD during five cruises of the 1988 Black Sea Oceanographic Expedition, from 16 April to 29 July 1988, we describe the distribution of potential temperature ($\theta$), salinity (S), and potential density ($\sigma$$\theta$) throughout the water column. The salinity and density increase rapidly with depth, while temperature decreases to a minimum at 50 m in the cold intermediate layer (CIL). All three variables increase slowly with depth in the deep water. The hydrographic properties of the upper 200 m varied little over the duration of the 1988 expedition. Significant differences are observed when the 1988 data are compared with the 1969 Atlantis II data set. All of the 1969 data are warmer at a given salinity than the 1988 data to a depth with a salinity of about 21.0%o. Possible causes for these changes are increased heat loss to the atmosphere and decreased freshwater input. The most distinctive feature in the deep water is a homogeneous benthic bottom layer that extends from about 1700 m to the bottom. There is a single pronounced step in all hydrographic properties at the top of this layer. Vertical transport across the upper boundary may be controlled by double diffusion driven by geothermal heat flow. The predicted double-diffusive heat flux agrees with geothermal heat flow to within a factor of 5. A simple box model with surface, entrainment and deep-water reservoirs is used to model the entrainment process and the residence time of deep water in the Black Sea. The results suggest that the Bosporus inflow entrains water with properties of the CIL. The ratio of entrainment to Bosporus inflow is 3.3. Assuming a Bosporus inflow of 312 km3 y−1, the resulting residence time of the deep water is 387 years. A total CO2 balance is used to calculate the flux of carbon into the deep water and $\Delta$14C balance is used to calculate the pre-nuclear value of $\Delta$14C = −200%o in the entrainment water. This highly depleted value would have resulted in an apparent age of 1400 years for the CIL and, probably, the surface water as well. If the carbon flux of biological origin was depleted to the same extent this may account for some of the differences in sedimentary chronology based on 14C dates and varve counts.},

abstract = {A two-layer analytical model is considered to examine the dynamics of cold isolated patches on the ocean floor. Such patches have been observed in the North Atlantic Ocean and are characterized by a bounding interface that intersects the bottom along a closed curve. They correspond, therefore, to isolated anticyclonic eddies with a lens-like cross section. The model incorporates steady movements resulting from the swirl velocity within the eddy and a topographically-induced translation. The movements are assumed to be frictionless and nondiffusive but are not restricted to be quasigeostrophic in the sense that the Rossby number is not necessarily small. For steady motions, analytical solutions are obtained using the full equations of motion in a coordinate system moving with the eddy itself. A uniformly sloping bottom causes a steady translation at 90?? to the right of the downhill direction. Thus, the model predicts that an anticyclonic eddy on the ocean floor will migrate along lines of constant depth. Suprisingly, the predicted translation speed depends only on the gravitational acceleration, the density difference between the layers, the Coriolis parameter, and the bottom slope. It is independent of the intensity, size, and depth of the eddy. For the range of parameters typical for the deep ocean, the predicted translation speed is 5 to 10 cm s-1. It is estimated that isolated eddies on the ocean floor may be able to carry temperature anomalies for a few thousand kilometers away from their origin. ?? 1983.},

abstract = {Abstract. We describe the physical model component of the standard Coastal Ocean version 5 configuration (CO5) of the European north-west shelf (NWS). CO5 was developed jointly between the Met Office and the National Oceanography Centre. CO5 is designed with the seamless approach in mind, which allows for modelling of multiple timescales for a variety of applications from short-range ocean forecasting to climate projections. The configuration constitutes the basis of the latest update to the ocean and data assimilation components of the Met Office's operational Forecast Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM) for the NWS. A 30.5-year non-assimilating control hindcast of CO5 was integrated from January 1981 to June 2012. Sensitivity simulations were conducted with reference to the control run. The control run is compared against a previous non-assimilating Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Modelling System (POLCOMS) hindcast of the NWS. The CO5 control hindcast is shown to have much reduced biases compared to POLCOMS. Emphasis in the system description is weighted to updates in CO5 over previous versions. Updates include an increase in vertical resolution, a new vertical coordinate stretching function, the replacement of climatological riverine sources with the pan-European hydrological model E-HYPE, a new Baltic boundary condition and switching from directly imposed atmospheric model boundary fluxes to calculating the fluxes within the model using a bulk formula. Sensitivity tests of the updates are detailed with a view toward attributing observed changes in the new system from the previous system and suggesting future directions of research to further improve the system.},

Each model is run with two different surface forcing datasets of different resolutions. Comparisons with a variety of observations from the Liverpool Bay Coastal Observatory show that increasing the surface forcing resolution improves the modelled surface temperature in all the models, in particular reducing the summer warm bias and winter cool bias. The response of surface salinity is more varied with improvements in some areas and deterioration in others. The 7 km NEMO model performs as well as the 1.8 km POLCOMS model when measured by overall skill scores, although the sources of error in the models are different. NEMO is too weakly stratified in Liverpool Bay, whereas POLCOMS is too strongly stratified. The horizontal salinity gradient, which is too strong in POLCOMS, is better reproduced by NEMO which uses a more diffusive horizontal advection scheme. This leads to improved semi-diurnal variability in salinity in NEMO at a mooring site located in the Liverpool Bay ROFI (region of freshwater influence) area.},

abstract = { Quasi-synoptic hydrographic data and satellite imagery are used to describe the circulation and the structural variability of the Black Sea with particular emphasis on the Turkish coast. The circulation is indicated to involve a variable cyclonic circulation with no apparent central locus and a well-defined cyclonic "Rim Current" containing meanders and interacting eddy fields confined to the shelf slope. Interspersed between the coastal eddies are filaments and intense jets, often with dipole eddies at their termina. The extension of these features across the shelf-slope into the central basin offshore waters implies important dynamical processes related to the shelf-deep basin exchange. These features are often steered by the topography and evolve continuously through the mixed baroclinic-barotropic instability of the Rim Current.},

@article{Orlic2009,
abstract = {A simple diagnostic model, reproducing circulation in lakes and marginal seas in which low-density waters are found close to the coasts while high-density waters dominate the offshore areas, is developed. An explicit solution is obtained for the central transverse section of an elongated basin, assuming that the Boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations are valid and that the alongshore variability vanishes. The model reveals cyclonic circulation that may either extend throughout the vertical (type C) or may top anticyclonic circulation developed in the bottom layer (type C/A). With the amplitude of the imposed density anomaly being fixed, the flow type is controlled by the frictional processes and by the basin dimensions. In a typical basin, type C/A flow is supported by weak bottom and vertical friction and by moderate lateral friction, unlike type C flow, which is supported by moderate bottom and vertical friction and by weak lateral friction. Strong frictional influence, especially in the basin interior, suppresses the flow everywhere. The flow is also suppressed in a basin that is narrow O(1 km) and shallow O(10 m), even without the frictional control being too strong. A basin that is narrow and deep favors type C/A flow, whereas a basin that is wide and shallow tends to support type C flow. The theoretical findings are related to observations, particularly those originating from the Adriatic Sea where type C flow prevails but may occasionally be replaced by type C/A flow, as well as to previous modeling results.},

A review of the physical environment is given. Seasonal and interannual climatic variability of the system are discussed in relation to its hydrology. Water mass variability and formation are studied, with emphasis on the inflow of Mediterranean waters, pycnocline variability, shelf and internal mixing, and double diffusive convection. The general circulation of the basin, and the roles of stratification, topography and coastline variations in determining the behaviour of the rapid, unstable boundary currents and upwelling along the coast are discussed, based on hydrographic data and satellite observations. Impacts of the physical processes on the ecosystem are discussed.},

abstract = {Ocean simulations are in part determined by topographic waves with speeds and spatial scales dependent on bottom slope. By their very nature, discrete z-level ocean models have problems accurately representing bottom topography when slopes are less than the grid cell aspect ratio $\Delta$z/$\Delta$x. In such regions, the dispersion relation for topographic waves is inaccurate. However, bottom topography can be accurately represented in discrete z-level models by allowing bottom-most grid cells to be partially filled with land. Consequently, gently sloping bottom topography is resolved on the scale of horizontal grid resolution and the dispersion relation for topographic waves is accurately approximated. In contrast to the standard approach using full cells, partial cells imply that all grid points within a vertical level are not necessarily at the same depth and problems arise with pressure gradient errors and the spurious diapycnal diffusion. However, both problems have been effectively dealt with. Differences in flow fields between simulations with full cells and partial cells can be significant, and simulations with partial cells are more robust than with full cells. Partial cells provide a superior representation of topographic waves when compared to the standard method employing full cells.},

abstract = {Although now over 100 years old, the classifica- tion of climate originally formulated by Wladimir K¨ oppen and modified by his collaborators and successors, is still in widespread use. It is widely used in teaching school and undergraduate courses on climate. It is also still in regular use by researchers across a range of disciplines as a basis for climatic regionalisation of variables and for assessing the output of global climate models. Here we have produced a new global map of climate using the K¨ oppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly pre- cipitation and temperature station time series. Climatic vari- ables used in the K¨ oppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations using a two- dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension onto a 0.1◦×0.1◦ grid for each continent. We discuss some problems in dealing with sites that are not uniquely classified into one climate type by the K¨ oppen-Geiger sys- tem and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis. Globally the most common climate type by land area is BWh (14.2{%}, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11.5{%}, Tropical savannah).

This model for the drift due to an individual breaking wave, together with the statistics of wave breaking measured in the field, are used to compute the Lagrangian drift of breaking waves in the ocean. It is found that breaking may contribute up to an additional 30% to the predicted values of the classical Stokes drift of the wave field for the field experiments considered here, which have wind speeds ranging from 1.6 to 16 m s−1, significant wave heights in the range of 0.7–4.7 m, and wave ages (defined here as cm/u*, for the spectrally weighted phase velocity cm and the wind friction velocity u*) ranging from 16 to 150. The drift induced by wave breaking becomes increasingly more important with increasing wind friction velocity and increasing significant wave height.},

Satellite observations in the North Sea show that surface SPM concentrations, in locations of its deposition, grow rapidly and build plume-shaped, long (many kilometers) uninterrupted and consistent structures during a storm. Also, satellites reveal that SPM rapidly sinks to the seabed after the storm peak has passed and wave height decreases (i.e., in the absence of strong turbulence). The nonbreaking wave-induced turbulence has been discussed, parameterized, and implemented into an equation of evolution of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in the frame of mean-flow concept, which can be used in existing circulation models. The ratio between dissipated and total wave energy is used to describe the influence of wave damping on the mean flow. The numerical tests reproduce experiments in a wave tank very well and are supported by observations of SPM in the North Sea. Their results show that the motion of an individual nonbreaking wave includes turbulent fluctuations if the critical Reynolds number for wave motion is exceeded, independent of the presence of currents due to wind or tides. These fluctuations can produce high diffusivity and strongly influence mixing in the upper water layer of the ocean.},

@article{Polton2005,
abstract = {The interaction between the Coriolis force and the Stokes drift associated with ocean surface waves leads to a vertical transport of momentum, which can be expressed as a force on the mean momentum equation in the direction along wave crests. How this Coriolis–Stokes forcing affects the mean current profile in a wind-driven mixed layer is investigated using simple models, results from large-eddy simulations, and observational data. The effects of the Coriolis–Stokes forcing on the mean current profile are examined by reappraising analytical solutions to the Ekman model that include the Coriolis–Stokes forcing. Turbulent momentum transfer is modeled using an eddy-viscosity model, first with a constant viscosity and second with a linearly varying eddy viscosity. Although the Coriolis–Stokes forcing penetrates only a small fraction of the depth of the wind-driven layer for parameter values typical of the ocean, the analytical solutions show how the current profile is substantially changed through the whole depth of the wind-driven layer. It is shown how, for this oceanic regime, the Coriolis–Stokes forcing supports a fraction of the applied wind stress, changing the boundary condition on the wind-driven component of the flow and hence changing the current profile through all depths. The analytical solution with the linearly varying eddy viscosity is shown to reproduce reasonably well the effects of the Coriolis–Stokes forcing on the current profile computed from large-eddy simulations, which resolve the three-dimensional overturning motions associated with the turbulent Langmuir circulations in the wind-driven layer. Last, the analytical solution with the Coriolis–Stokes forcing is shown to agree reasonably well with current profiles from previously published observational data and certainly agrees better than the standard Ekman model. This finding provides evidence that the Coriolis–Stokes forcing is an important mechanism in controlling the dynamics of the upper ocean.},

@article{Reffray2015,
abstract = {Abstract. Through two numerical experiments, a 1-D vertical model called NEMO1D was used to investigate physical and numerical turbulent-mixing behaviour. The results show that all the turbulent closures tested (k+l from Blanke and Delecluse, 1993, and two equation models: generic length scale closures from Umlauf and Burchard, 2003) are able to correctly reproduce the classical test of Kato and Phillips (1969) under favourable numerical conditions while some solutions may diverge depending on the degradation of the spatial and time discretization. The performances of turbulence models were then compared with data measured over a 1-year period (mid-2010 to mid-2011) at the PAPA station, located in the North Pacific Ocean. The modelled temperature and salinity were in good agreement with the observations, with a maximum temperature error between −2 and 2 °C during the stratified period (June to October). However, the results also depend on the numerical conditions. The vertical RMSE varied, for different turbulent closures, from 0.1 to 0.3 °C during the stratified period and from 0.03 to 0.15 °C during the homogeneous period. This 1-D configuration at the PAPA station (called PAPA1D) is now available in NEMO as a reference configuration including the input files and atmospheric forcing set described in this paper. Thus, all the results described can be recovered by downloading and launching PAPA1D. The configuration is described on the NEMO site (http://www.nemo-ocean.eu/Using-NEMO/Configurations/C1D_PAPA). This package is a good starting point for further investigation of vertical processes.},

abstract = {The study presented in this paper is motivated by the unexplained time dependency of the Ekman model recently computed by Rio et al. using a dataset of “drogued” drifting buoy velocities distributed by the Surface Drifter Data Assembly Center (SD-DAC). This suspicious behavior is found to be fully explained by the presence of undrogued buoys in the drogued drifters database (Grodsky et al.). Altimeter and wind data are used to extract the direct wind slippage from the total drifting buoy velocities over the period 1993–2010. The obtained wind slippage values are then analyzed to identify probable undrogued data among the drifting buoy velocities dataset. The proportion of probable undrogued data among the drogued buoy velocities distributed by SD-DAC is found to be 48%, with an important spatial and temporal variability. When averaged over the full 1993–2010 period, the wind slippage affecting these undrogued buoy velocities reaches up to 13 cm s−1 in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. A simple procedure is applied to produce an updated dataset, including a drogue presence flag as well as a wind slippage correction. The drogued drifter data from this new dataset are finally used to estimate a new, stable over time Ekman model for the global ocean by latitudinal band and by month.},

The authors derive a relation between these diapycnal transfers and the dissipation of vorticity gradients. An increase in model resolution does not significantly reduce the diapycnal transfers since vorticity gradients cascade to smaller scales and must ultimately be dissipated to maintain numerical stability. This is confirmed in an idealized primitive equation ocean model at a variety of resolutions between 1° and 1/8°. Thus, the authors conclude that adiabatic dissipation schemes are required, even in eddy-resolving ocean models. The authors propose and implement a new biharmonic form of the Gent and McWilliams scheme, which adiabatically dissipates at the grid scale while preserving larger-scale features.},

abstract = {The air-sea exchange in the Black Sea is revisited in the paper on the base of data provided from the ECMWF atmospheric re-analysis for the period 1979-1993. Climatological characteristics of analysis data are compared against available climatic data, demonstrating quite a good consistency. Several drawbacks are found: too low temperatures in the easternmost part of the sea, too low dew point temperature and slight underestimation of precipitation. However, the seasonal and inter-annual oscillations are resolved correctly, as well as the horizontal patterns of air-sea exchange. The shallow penetration of thermal signal in the Black Sea is well detected by the very small heat transports inferred from the ECMWF data. Thus, the conclusion is that the analysis 'sees' quite well the major thermal peculiarity of the Black Sea associated with its extremely small thermal inertia caused by the specific stratification. {{\textcopyright}} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Cascading is a specific type of buoyancy-driven current in which dense water formed by cooling, evaporation, or freezing in the surface layer over the continental shelf descends down the continental slope to a greater depth. We have identified, by world-wide trawling and analysis of raw databases, several distinct mechanisms of preconditioning for cascades. We have validated, where possible, existing theories and developed simple models, which allow estimation of the parameters for preconditioning, initiating, and down-slope fluxes as well as evolution of the temperature contrasts during cascading events. Compliance or noncompliance of observations with these simple and easy-to-use models has been related to the stage of cascade development and to local factors. Estimates of observed down-slope transport rates in case studies accord with theory, which is thereby substantially validated. Typical values of cascading transport rates were in the range 0.5-1.6 m(2) s(-1). We hazard a very approximate global estimate of order 10(5) km(3) yr(-1) or average 3 Sv based on our findings and previous studies.},

abstract = {Plumes of dense shelf water cascade down continental slopes in many parts of the world's oceans and provide a mechanism for shelf-ocean exchange. In this paper a nonlinear process-orientated theory is developed and used to examine the dynamics of cascading. The theory is formulated ill terms of a ''1 1/2-layer'' model and incorporates bottom topography, earth rotation, internal and bottom friction, and entrainment as well as externally imposed pressure gradients. The theory occupies a niche between the stream tube class of model (which considers only bulk properties of a plume) and the full three-dimensional primitive equation approach. The model provides useful insights into the complex interplay between the controlling forces, and it allows one to recover the shape and trajectory of dense plumes as well as the three-dimensional flow field inside the bottom layer. Asymptotic limits are investigated and lead to several basic results. A typical thickness of a fully developed plume is found to be twice the bottom Ekman layer scale, corresponding to reported observations. The relative importance of downslope density-driven cascading and downslope drainage forced by interior currents is assessed. It is found that vertical mixing always assists downslope plume propagation. while an interior current may assist or inhibit cascading. The model is applied to some recent observations at the Hebridean shelf edge west of the British Isles and is used to infer the characteristics of an observed cascade. The model could also be applied to double frontal currents such as the Mediterranean outflow},

abstract = {Abstract. Long-term changes in the state of the Bottom Shelf Water (BSW) on the Western shelf of the Black Sea are assessed using analysis of intra-seasonal and inter-annual temperature variations. For the purpose of this study the BSW is defined as such shelf water mass between the seabed and the upper mixed layer (bounded by the &sigma;&theta; = 14.2 isopycnal) which has limited ability to mix vertically with oxygen-rich surface waters during the warm season due to formation of a seasonal pycnocline. A long-term time series of temperature anomalies in the BSW is constructed from in-situ observations taken over the 2nd half of the 20th century. The BSW is shown to occupy nearly half of the shelf area during the summer stratification period (May–November).The results reveal a warm phase in the 1960s/70s, followed by a cold phase between 1985 and 1995 and a further warming after 1995. The transition between the warm and cold periods coincides with a regime shift in the Black Sea ecosystem. While it was confirmed that the memory of winter convection is well preserved over the following months in the deep sea, the signal of winter cooling in the BSW significantly reduces during the warm season. The potential of the BSW to ventilate horizontally during the warm season with the deep-sea waters is assessed using isopycnic analysis of temperature variations. It is shown that temperature in the BSW is stronger correlated with the temperature of Cold Intermediate Waters (CIW) in the deep sea than with the severity of the previous winters, thus indicating that the isopycnal exchanges with the deep sea are more important for inter-annual/inter-decadal variability of the BSW on the western Black Sea shelf than effects of winter convection on the shelf itself.},

abstract = {Satellite derived full resolution data on chlorophyll, water leaving radiance, sea surface temperature, as well as altimetry data are used to characterise the process of shelf-open sea exchange induced by an individual mesoscale eddy off the North West coast of the Black Sea in the summer 2005. The shelf edge front in the NW part of the Black Sea separates biologically productive and often eutrophicated shelf waters from the open sea waters. A large mesoscale eddy (diameter about 120 km) was formed away from the shelf front southwest of Crimean peninsula in the spring 2005. The eddy moved towards the shelf break and repeatedly attached itself to the shelf edge front causing its disturbance and formation of a cross-shelf jet and a Chl-a rich filament spiralling around the eddy periphery. The jet represented an important cross-shelf transport mechanism sustaining an average cross-frontal flux of shelf waters of 0.3 Sv over period of 40 days. The total transport of water in our case study was equivalent to 40% of the overall volume of water on the shelf. Formation of the filament significantly increased the length of contact between shelf and deep sea waters from 70 km at the base of filament to about 800 km along its sides, thus providing a highly efficient mixing mechanism. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This work provides a function for discretising the vertical coordinate in ocean models that is designed to allow the user to define a fixed surface resolution, as one can in geopotential coordinate models, whilst retaining the benefits of terrain-following coordinates. This formulation has been termed the ?? stretching function and provides an analytical solution that, in contrast with hybrid schemes, allows gradual coordinate changes in the vertical and horizontal. The early part of the paper describes the theoretical framework in which this can be done. Following this a series of steps that are required to effectively implement the coordinate have been described, and a full description of the implementation for a shelf model, the Forecasting Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM) Atlantic Margin Model (AMM7), is given.This implementation is then used to quantify the impact of the ?? stretching compared with the current stretching scheme. This shows the new stretching to have improved slope and hydrostatic consistency parameters. As would therefore be expected the ?? stretching is shown to give rise to reduced horizontal pressure gradient errors in an idealised seamount test case. The benefits of a constant and shallow box for air-sea exchange are demonstrated, with the ?? stretching giving enhanced diurnal ranges, increased sea surface temperatures and shallower mixed layer depths where the FOAM AMM7 is presently unable to well represent these properties. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Abstract. The temporal and spatial variability of the upper ocean hydrochemistry in the Black Sea is analysed using data originating from profiling floats with oxygen sensors and carried out with a coupled three-dimensional circulation-biogeochemical model including 24 biochemical state variables. Major focus is on the dynamics of suboxic zone which is the interface separating oxygenated and anoxic waters. The scatter of oxygen data seen when plotted in density coordinates is larger than those for temperature, salinity and passive tracers. This scatter is indicative of vigorous biogeochemical reactions in the suboxic zone, which acts as a boundary layer or internal sink for oxygen. This internal sink affects the mixing patterns of oxygen compared to the ones of conservative tracers. Two different regimes of ventilation of pycnocline were clearly identified: a gyre-dominated (cyclonic) regime in winter and a coastal boundary layer (anticyclonic eddy)-dominated regime in summer. These contrasting states are characterized by very different pathways of oxygen intrusions along the isopycnals and vertical oxygen conveyor belt organized in multiple-layered cells formed in each gyre. The contribution of the three-dimensional modelling to the understanding of the Black Sea hydro-chemistry, and in particular the coast-to-open-sea mixing, is also demonstrated. Evidence is given that the formation of oxic waters and of cold intermediate waters, although triggered by the same physical process, each follow a different evolution. The difference in the depths of the temperature minimum and the oxygen maximum indicates that the variability of oxygen is not only just a response to physical forcing and changes in the surface conditions, but undergoes its own evolution.},

abstract = {A numerical model of the Black Sea circulation is developed using the Bryan-Cox-Semtner modular ocean model. Some available climatic and atmospheric analysis data are used to force the model. The analysis of the simulations gives a strong motivation to construct new sea surface forcing functions for this basin. It is shown that they provide heat and water fluxes that are consistent with the observations and with some independent balance estimates. The improved model forcing results in simulating of a realistic circulation. The inflow through the Strait of Bosphorus is parameterized using physical concepts, based on theoretical models and observational data, relating the strait exchange to the net fresh water flux at sea surface. A new parameterization is included to simulate the Mediterranean plume. The model sensitivity to driving forces, physical processes, and different parameterizations is studied. The results are used to tune the model to simulate adequately the water mass formation. The most sensitive elements of the vertical stratification, as the cold intermediate layer and the deep temperature intrusions, are used in this tuning. The model circulation, ventilation of the deep and intermediate layers, some characteristic time and length scales show a good agreement with the observations. The cooling capacity of the intermediate water is analysed as dependent on the fresh water flux at sea surface. The model simulations give indications that the changes in thermal stratification in the intermediate depths are indicative not only for how severe the preceding winter was. These changes are also dependent on the variability in the fresh water. In a long run, they could illustrate climate changes in the catchment area of the Black Sea rivers.},

@article{Stanev1999a,
abstract = {The Black Sea general circulation is simulated by a primitive equation model with active free surface. The forcing is seasonally variable and is based on available climatic data. The model reproduces the main features of the Black Sea circulation, including the river discharge effects on the mean sea level and the Bosphorus outflow. Model results show that the simulated sea surface elevation increases in spring over the whole sea, reaching a maximum in the Danube delta area. In the same region, a minimum is observed in winter. The amplitude of the seasonal oscillations (about 8–12 cm over the whole basin) is of the same order of magnitude as the maximum horizontal variations (about 15–18 cm between the coastal areas and the basin interior). This strong signal formed mostly by river discharges, along with the seasonal variability in the other forcing functions and the local dynamics creates a well-pronounced interannual variability. The performance of the model in simulating the seasonal and interannual variability is critically analyzed, with a special attention on the cold intermediate water formation and the circulation in the upper 150 m. The simulations demonstrate that the source of intermediate waters is on the shelf, and that the water mass in the core of cold intermediate layer changes with time as a response to the periodic forcing at sea surface. This type of variability is characterized by pronounced interannual changes, proving that important differences could exist between water mass structure in different years, even when using identical atmospheric forcings each year.},

abstract = {We address in this paper the planetary basin modes and their possible impact on the circulation of Black Sea. These oscillations could become important in semi-enclosed seas where the horizontal scales are smaller than the barotropic radius of deformation and the baroclinic radius of deformation is comparable with the basin scales. The physical balances studied here are based on theoretical results for the Rossby modes in rectangular basins and on model simulations carried out with Bryan-Cox ocean model with eddy resolution. Eddies with horizontal scales of 100-200 km spontaneously form and propagate to the west with phase velocity of few kilometers per day. External mode oscillations dominate the model solution and show close similarity with estimates based on simplistic theoretical models. In the baroclinic oceans these oscillations trigger active baroclinic variability and western propagation, but with strongly modified wave characteristics in comparison to the barotropic case. The comparisons between simulations and data from surveys and altimeters demonstrates that the planetary modes are a dominating form of wave motion in this sea and can explain the westward propagation of signals in its deep part. It is suggested that the excitation of rotational modes can be also important for the dispersion of tracers.},

abstract = {Bryan's (1989) model is used in this study to simulate the circulation in the Black Sea. Wind stress, heat exchange, precipitation and evaporation at sea surface are prescribed from climatic data. River inflow and the inflow from the Mediterranean Sea are taken from observations. Two types of models are discussed: GCM with horizontal resolution$\Delta$$\lambda$ = 1°, $\Delta$$\phi$ = 0.5° and 12 levels; and EGCM with horizontal resolution$\Delta$$\lambda$ = 20′,$\Delta$$\phi$ = 10′ on the same levels. GCM is designed to study the role of the wind and buoyancy fluxes for the establishment of circulation. Model data shows that in the baroclinic experiments kinetic energy is less than in the barotropic experiment. This is a consequence of the formation of a strong halocline in the upper layer, where a substantial part of the energy input transforms into potential energy. The specific vertical stratification in the Black Sea restricts the penetration of seasonal signal into deep layers, and preconditions the establishment of a cold intermediate layer. Model data from EGCM shows that eddies contribute to some change in the transport mechanisms, compared to those in GCM. Seasonal forcing affects substantially the variability of the main Black Sea gyre. Comparisons between model and observational data indicate that models resolve the main features of the Black Sea circulation. They illustrate correctly physical processes in strong stratified geophysical fluids, and particularly in semi-enclosed basins, where precipitation and runoff exceeds evaporation.},

Simulated data are produced by a three-dimensional circulation model that includes a new parameterization of the Bosphorus inflow/plume to simulate the effects of Mediterranean water on internal mixing, A radioactive tracer model for pre-Chernobyl Cs-137 (weapons testing Cs-137) and Chernobyl Cs-137 is coupled to the circulation model. The model results are compared to field data collected between 1986 and 1992. The main output from the simulations is the identification of the contribution of entrainment in the mixing of surface waters into subsurface layers. The trend of tracer penetration into the deeper layers following isopycnal surfaces is well demonstrated in the model and is consistent with the known circulation and physics of the Black Sea. The correlation between the activities of radionuclides and salinity, found in the field data, is supported by the simulations. These model results illustrate that the time-space abundance of the existing field data is sufficient for reconstructing the distribution of tracers in space and time, provided reliable estimates of Black Sea circulation exist},

abstract = {The DieCAST ocean model is applied to a study of the circulation in the Black Sea, using 1/12° horizontal resolution and with 20 vertical layers. Boundary forcings are monthly wind stress, evaporation minus precipitation, air–sea heat flux, freshwater influx from 11 rivers and exchange with the Mediterranean Sea through the Bosphorus Strait. The model reproduces fundamental physical features of the Black Sea: seasonal fluctuations in the quasi-permanent cyclonic Rim Current, numerous anticyclonic meanders and eddies lying between the Rim Current and the coast, Rossby waves propagating westward across the basin, coastally trapped waves, and the annual cycle of vertical mixing. Model results shed light on the mechanisms affecting such features. These include interactions of the Rim Current with coastal bathymetry abutments, leading to recirculations that pinch off vortices as in island wakes, and possible baroclinic instability of the Rim Current; these are modulated by the large annual stratification cycle above a relatively shallow and strong pycnocline, as is the Rim Current itself. The resulting wake eddies often merge into major coastal circulation features such as the seasonal Batumi and Sevastopol eddies. These anticyclonic eddies play a fundamental role in coastal and open-sea exchange processes. Hydrographic data from sampling cruises and recent Topex–Poseiden (T/P) altimeter data strongly supports our analysis.},

abstract = {This study investigates the effects of wind–wave processes in a coupled wave–ocean circulation model on Lagrangian transport simulations. Drifters deployed in the southern North Sea from May to June 2015 are used. The Eulerian currents are obtained by simulation from the coupled circulation model (NEMO) and the wave model (WAM), as well as a stand-alone NEMO circulation model. The wave–current interaction processes are the momentum and energy sea state dependent fluxes, wave-induced mixing and Stokes–Coriolis forcing. The Lagrangian transport model sensitivity to these wave-induced processes in NEMO is quantified using a particle drift model. Wind waves act as a reservoir for energy and momentum. In the coupled wave–ocean circulation model, the momentum that is transferred into the ocean model is considered as a fraction of the total flux that goes directly to the currents plus the momentum lost from wave dissipation. Additional sensitivity studies are performed to assess the potential contribution of windage on the Lagrangian model performance. Wave-induced drift is found to significantly affect the particle transport in the upper ocean. The skill of particle transport simulations depends on wave–ocean circulation interaction processes. The model simulations were assessed using drifter and high-frequency (HF) radar observations. The analysis of the model reveals that Eulerian currents produced by introducing wave-induced parameterization into the ocean model are essential for improving particle transport simulations. The results show that coupled wave–circulation models may improve transport simulations of marine litter, oil spills, larval drift or transport of biological materials.},

abstract = {Abstract. This study addresses the impact of coupling between wave and circulation models on the quality of coastal ocean predicting systems. This is exemplified for the German Bight and its coastal area known as the Wadden Sea. The latter is the area between the barrier islands and the coast. This topic reflects the increased interest in operational oceanography to reduce prediction errors of state estimates at coastal scales, which in many cases are due to unresolved non-linear feedback between strong currents and wind waves. In this study we present analysis of wave and hydrographic observations, as well as results of numerical simulations. A nested-grid modelling system is used to produce reliable nowcasts and short-term forecasts of ocean state variables, including waves and hydrodynamics. The database includes ADCP observations and continuous measurements from data stations. The individual and combined effects of wind, waves and tidal forcing are quantified. The performance of the forecast system is illustrated for the cases of several extreme events. The combined role of wave effects on coastal circulation and sea level are investigated by considering the wave-dependent stress and wave breaking parameterization. Also the response, which the circulation exerts on the waves, is tested for the coastal areas. The improved skill of the coupled forecasts compared to the non-coupled ones, in particular during extreme events, justifies the further enhancements of coastal operational systems by including wave effects in circulation models.},

abstract = {Abstract. This study addresses the impact of wind, waves, tidal forcing and baroclinicity on the sea level of the German Bight during extreme storm events. The role of wave-induced processes, tides and baroclinicity is quantified, and the results are compared with in situ measurements and satellite data. A coupled high-resolution modelling system is used to simulate wind waves, the water level and the three-dimensional hydrodynamics. The models used are the wave model WAM and the circulation model GETM. The two-way coupling is performed via the OASIS3-MCT coupler. The effects of wind waves on sea level variability are studied, accounting for wave-dependent stress, wave-breaking parameterization and wave-induced effects on vertical mixing. The analyses of the coupled model results reveal a closer match with observations than for the stand-alone circulation model, especially during the extreme storm Xaver in December 2013. The predicted surge of the coupled model is significantly enhanced during extreme storm events when considering wave–current interaction processes. This wave-dependent approach yields a contribution of more than 30% in some coastal areas during extreme storm events. The contribution of a fully three-dimensional model compared with a two-dimensional barotropic model showed up to 20% differences in the water level of the coastal areas of the German Bight during Xaver. The improved skill resulting from the new developments justifies further use of the coupled-wave and three-dimensional circulation models in coastal flooding predictions.},

abstract = {The wind-driven stably stratified mid-latitude oceanic surface turbulent boundary layer is computationally simulated in the presence of a specified surface gravity-wave field. The gravity waves have broad wavenumber and frequency spectra typical of measured conditions in near-equilibrium with the mean wind speed. The simulation model is based on (i) an asymptotic theory for the conservative dynamical effects of waves on the wave-averaged boundary-layer currents and (ii) a boundary-layer forcing by a stochastic representation of the impulses and energy fluxes in a field of breaking waves. The wave influences are shown to be profound on both the mean current profile and turbulent statistics compared to a simulation without these wave influences and forced by an equivalent mean surface stress. As expected from previous studies with partial combinations of these wave influences, Langmuir circulations due to the wave-averaged vortex force make vertical eddy fluxes of momentum and material concentration much more efficient and non-local (i.e. with negative eddy viscosity near the surface), and they combine with the breakers to increase the turbulent energy and dissipation rate. They also combine in an unexpected positive feedback in which breaker-generated vorticity seeds the creation of a new Langmuir circulation and instigates a deep strong intermittent downwelling jet that penetrates through the boundary layer and increases the material entrainment rate at the base of the layer. These wave effects on the boundary layer are greater for smaller wave ages and higher mean wind speeds.},

These marine prediction systems include ocean circulation models, atmospheric models, and surface wave models. Two leeway models are tested for use in drift object prediction: an implicit leeway model where the Stokes drift is implicit in the leeway coefficient, and an explicit leeway model where the Stokes drift is provided by the wave model. Both leeway coefficients are allowed to vary in direction and time in order to perfectly reproduce the observed drifter trajectory. This creates a time series of the leeway coefficients that exactly reproduce the observed drifter trajectories. Mean values for the leeway coefficients are consistent with previous studies that utilized direct observations of the leeway. For all drifters and models, the largest source of variance in the leeway coefficient occurs at the inertial frequency and the evidence suggests it is related to uncertainties in the ocean inertial currents.},

We advance three propositions about the special relationship between environmental science and politics: (1) in the formulation of science, not just in its application, certain courses of action are facilitated over others; (2) in global environmental discourse, moral and technocratic views of social action have been privileged; and (3) global environmental change, as science and movement ideology, is vulnerable to deconstructive pressures. These stem from different nations and differentiated social groups within nations having different interests in causing and alleviating environmental problems. We develop these propositions through a reconstruction of The Limits to Growth study of the early 1970s, make extensions to current studies of the human/social impacts of climate change, and review current sources of opposition to global and political formulations of environmental issues. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {Seasonal field observations show that the North Sea, a Northern European shelf sea, is highly efficient in pumping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the North Atlantic Ocean. The bottom topography-controlled stratification separates production and respiration processes in the North Sea, causing a carbon dioxide increase in the subsurface layer that is ultimately exported to the North Atlantic Ocean. Globally extrapolated, the net uptake of carbon dioxide by coastal and marginal seas is about 20{%} of the world ocean's uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide, thus enhancing substantially the open ocean carbon dioxide storage.},

We employ CTD data collected during a campaign around the Elba island to calibrate and validate SURF. The model requires an initial spin up period of a few days in order to adapt the initial interpolated fields and the subsequent solutions to the higher-resolution nested grids adopted by SURF. Through a comparison with the CTD data, we quantify the improvement obtained by SURF model compared to the coarse-resolution MFS model.},

@article{Tsunogai1999,
abstract = {Based on the results obtained in the East China Sea, we propose a new term, Continental Shelf Pump, as a mechanism for the absorption of atmospheric CO2. We investigated the carbonate system of the East China Sea along a single observation line traversing its central part on 5 cruises in various seasons. The directly observed fugacity of CO2 dissolved in the surface water decreased with decreasing salinity and temperature as well as nutrient content. The relation has been expressed as a simple equation of these 3 parameters. Putting the observed data on the parameters in the various parts of the East China Sea in various months into this equation, we have obtained 55 ± 5 ppm as an annual mean fugacity deficit of CO2 in the surface water of the East China Sea, which nearly equals the directly measured mean fugacity along the observation line. The net absorption flux estimated from the fugacity deficit has agreed with the amount of carbonate transported out of the East China Sea calculated for the distributions of total dissolved carbonate and alkalinity. The distributions of density and total dissolved carbonate reveal the cause of this large deficiency, described as follows. The shallower shelf zone is more cooled than the open sea when heat is lost from the surface. This cooling produces denser water, which together with photosynthetic activity, accelerates the absorption of CO2 in the shelf zone. The absorbed CO2 is transformed to organic carbon and regenerated especially at the shallow bottom. Isopycnal mixing (advection and diffusion) transports the denser coastal water, especially the bottom water enriched in dissolved and particulate carbon, into the subsurface layer of the open oceans. The transport continues in the layer below the pycnocline even in the warm season and maintains the low fugacity of CO2 in the surface water of the shelf zone. This is the continental shelf pump. The pump would account for a net oceanic uptake of CO2 of 1 GtC/ yr, if the world continental shelf zone would absorb the atmospheric CO2 at the rate observed in the East China Sea.},

@article{VandenBremer2018,
abstract = {During its periodic motion, a particle floating at the free surface of a water wave experiences a net drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation, known as the Stokes drift (Stokes 1847 Trans. Camb. Philos. Soc. 8 , 441–455). More generally, the Stokes drift velocity is the difference between the average Lagrangian flow velocity of a fluid parcel and the average Eulerian flow velocity of the fluid. This paper reviews progress in fundamental and applied research on the induced mean flow associated with surface gravity waves since the first description of the Stokes drift, now 170 years ago. After briefly reviewing the fundamental physical processes, most of which have been established for decades, the review addresses progress in laboratory and field observations of the Stokes drift. Despite more than a century of experimental studies, laboratory studies of the mean circulation set up by waves in a laboratory flume remain somewhat contentious. In the field, rapid advances are expected due to increasingly small and cheap sensors and transmitters, making widespread use of small surface-following drifters possible. We also discuss remote sensing of the Stokes drift from high-frequency radar. Finally, the paper discusses the three main areas of application of the Stokes drift: in the coastal zone, in Eulerian models of the upper ocean layer and in the modelling of tracer transport, such as oil and plastic pollution. Future climate models will probably involve full coupling of ocean and atmosphere systems, in which the wave model provides consistent forcing on the ocean surface boundary layer. Together with the advent of new space-borne instruments that can measure surface Stokes drift, such models hold the promise of quantifying the impact of wave effects on the global atmosphere–ocean system and hopefully contribute to improved climate projections.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional flow in the mixed layer associated with Langmuir circulation was studied with a new instrument capable of directly measuring the three components of v velocity. Regions of convergent surface flow were located with surface drifters. In these regions the downward vertical and downwind horizontal components of the flow were comparable in size and, at times, in excess of 20 cm s−1. This downwind, dowmwelling flow was jet-like in structure, with the maximum velocity located below the surface. Away from the downwelling regions and in the lower half of the mixed layer below the convergence zones, the flow associated with the Langmuir cells was an order of magnitude smaller and not well resolved in these experiments. On some occasions, when Langmuir cells appeared suddenly, they were able to mix the weak nearsurface stratification that had formed in response to diurnal heating. They could also maintain large shears in the well-mixed fluid near the surface. They did not, however, penetrate with strength to the base of relict mixed layers observed during summer-like conditions or to the base of deeper, more isothermal, mixed layers observed during stormy conditions.},

abstract = {Atmospheric storms are an important driver of changes in upper-ocean stratification and small-scale (1–100 m) turbulence. Yet, the modifying effects of submesoscale (0.1–10 km) motions in the ocean mixed layer on stratification and small-scale turbulence during a storm are not well understood. Here, large-eddy simulations are used to study the coupled response of submesoscale and small-scale turbulence to the passage of an idealized autumn storm, with a wind stress representative of a storm observed in the North Atlantic above the Porcupine Abyssal Plain. Because of a relatively shallow mixed layer and a strong downfront wind, existing scaling theory predicts that submesoscales should be unable to restratify the mixed layer during the storm. In contrast, the simulations reveal a persistent and strong mean stratification in the mixed layer both during and after the storm. In addition, the mean dissipation rate remains elevated throughout the mixed layer during the storm, despite the strong mean stratification. These results are attributed to strong spatial variability in stratification and small-scale turbulence at the submesoscale and have important implications for sampling and modeling submesoscales and their effects on stratification and turbulence in the upper ocean.},

abstract = {The general circulation in the North Sea and Skagerrak is simulated using the hybrid coordinate ocean model (HYCOM). Although HYCOM was originally developed for simulations of the open ocean, it has a design which should make it applicable also for coastal and shallow shelf seas. Thus, the objective of this study has been to examine the skills of the present version of HYCOM in a coastal shelf application, and to identify the areas where HYCOM needs to be further developed. To demonstrate the capability of the vertical coordinate in HYCOM, three experiments with different configurations of the vertical coordinate were carried out. In general, the results from these experiments compares quite well with in situ and satellite data, and the water masses and the general circulation in the North Sea and Skagerrak is reproduced in the simulations. Differences between the three experiments are small compared to other errors, which are related to a combined effect of model setup and properties of the vertical mixing scheme. Hence, it is difficult to quantify which vertical coordinate configuration works best for the coastal region. It is concluded that HYCOM can be used for simulations of coastal and shelf seas, and further suggestions for improving the model results are given. Since HYCOM also works well in open ocean and basin scale simulations, it may allow for a realistic modelling of the transition region between the open ocean and coastal shelf seas. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A plume of dense brine-enriched water, resulting from sea ice production in the Storfjorden polynya (Svalbard), cascades into Fram Strait and encounters a layer of warm, saline Atlantic Water. In some years the plume continues to sink into the deep Fram Strait while in other years it remains at Atlantic Layer depths. It has been unclear what parameters control whether the plume pierces the Atlantic Layer or not.We use a high-resolution 3-D numerical ocean model (NEMO-SHELF) to simulate an idealised scenario where a cascade descends a conical slope into an ambient 3-layer stratification. The model uses 1. km horizontal resolution and a blend of s- and z coordinates with 42 layers in the vertical arranged to resolve the plume at the bottom. We vary the salinity '. S' and the flow rate '. Q' of the simulated Storfjorden overflow to investigate both strong and weak cascading conditions. In agreement with observations the model reproduces three regimes: (i) the plume is arrested within or just below the Atlantic Layer, (ii) the plume pierces the Atlantic Layer and continues to the bottom of the slope and an intermediate regime (iii) where a portion of the plume detaches from the bottom, intrudes into the Atlantic Layer while the remainder continues its downslope propagation. For our idealised case the cascading regime can be predicted from the initial values of S and Q. In those model experiments where the initial density of the overflow water is considerably greater than of the deepest ambient water mass we find that a cascade with high initial S does not necessarily reach the bottom if Q is low. Conversely, cascades with an initial density just slightly higher than the deepest ambient layer may flow to the bottom if the flow rate Q is high. A functional relationship between S/. Q and the final depth level of plume waters is explained by the flux of potential energy (arising from the introduction of dense water at shallow depth) which, in our idealised setting, represents the only energy source for downslope descent and mixing. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract. In this article we propose two grid generation methods for global ocean general circulation models. Contrary to conventional dipolar or tripolar grids, the proposed methods are based on Schwarz–Christoffel conformal mappings that map areas with user-prescribed, irregular boundaries to those with regular boundaries (i.e., disks, slits, etc.). The first method aims at improving existing dipolar grids. Compared with existing grids, the sample grid achieves a better trade-off between the enlargement of the latitudinal–longitudinal portion and the overall smooth grid cell size transition. The second method addresses more modern and advanced grid design requirements arising from high-resolution and multi-scale ocean modeling. The generated grids could potentially achieve the alignment of grid lines to the large-scale coastlines, enhanced spatial resolution in coastal regions, and easier computational load balance. Since the grids are orthogonal curvilinear, they can be easily utilized by the majority of ocean general circulation models that are based on finite difference and require grid orthogonality. The proposed grid generation algorithms can also be applied to the grid generation for regional ocean modeling where complex land–sea distribution is present.},

abstract = {A large (80-90 km in diameter) anticyclonic eddy centered at 43°N, 37-38°E has been the subject of complex investigation in the summer-autumn of 1999 based on measurements carried out during the "Black Sea'99" expedition on board of R/V Akvanavt (CTD surveys, deployment of Argos-tracked drifters), analysis of satellite imagery, and using altimetric sea level anomaly maps from merged TOPEX/POSEIDON and ERS-2 satellite data. The eddy was formed as a nearshore anticyclonic eddy (NAE) in the Sochi-Sukhumi region, separated from the coast on 6-9 April 1999, stayed at the center of the eastern basin, which is usually characterized by cyclonic circulation, during about 8 months and decayed near the Turkish coast in December 1999. A compilation of hydrodynamic situations of different years (1993, 1997-1999) suggests that similar open sea anticyclonic eddies are frequently the elements of the circulation in the eastern Black Sea in the warm season (April-December). A positive correlation appears to be between eddies' formation and weak macroscale circulation associated with low atmospheric wind forcing. Long lifetime of open sea anticyclones is likely determined by their interaction with neighboring eddies. NAEs' separation from the coast and their transformation into open sea eddies provide horizontal mixing of the upper layer waters and results in deflection of the Rim Current offshore, formation of large meanders of the current around the eddies, and its branching when rounding such features. An example of calculation of cross-shelf water transport relating to an offshore Rim Current branch is presented. It is pointed out that an estimation of the shelf/open sea water exchange based on the box balance model does not contradict the assumption that such exchange is considerably determined by NAEs' separation from the coast.},

@article{Zodiatis2016a,
abstract = {{{\textcopyright}} 2016 Elsevier LtdIn the Mediterranean sea the risk from oil spill pollution is high due to the heavy traffic of merchant vessels for transporting oil and gas, especially after the recent enlargement of the Suez canal and to the increasing coastal and offshore installations related to the oil industry in general. The basic response to major oil spills includes different measures and equipment. However, in order to strengthen the maritime safety related to oil spill pollution in the Mediterranean and to assist the response agencies, a multi-model oil spill prediction service has been set up, known as MEDESS-4MS (Mediterranean Decision Support System for Marine Safety). The concept behind the MEDESS-4MS service is the integration of the existing national ocean forecasting systems in the region with the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and their interconnection, through a dedicated network data repository, facilitating access to all these data and to the data from the oil spill monitoring platforms, including the satellite data ones, with the well established oil spill models in the region. The MEDESS-4MS offer a range of service scenarios, multi-model data access and interactive capabilities to suite the needs of REMPEC (Regional Marine Pollution Emergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean Sea) and EMSA-CSN (European Maritime Safety Agency-CleanseaNet).},
